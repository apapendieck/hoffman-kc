<h3>TransientObjectContainer - Add</h3>
<h4>  Transient Object Containers</h4>
<p>     A Transient Object Container contains objects which expire after
     a user-settable period of time.  Items placed into transient object
     must have string keys, but may have any type of value.</p>
<h4>  Common Usages</h4>
<p>     A Transient Object Container is used by Session Data Managers to store
     session data.</p>
<h4>  To create a Transient Object Container, specify the following:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Id</strong><p>       The Zope id of the Transient Object Container.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong> <p>       <em>Optional</em></p>
<p>       The title of the object.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Data object timeout (in minutes)</strong><p>       The minimum number of minutes that objects in the container will
       persist for.  Objects in the container are passively deleted, so
       they may not be deleted exactly after this number of minutes elapses.
       A setting of "0" indicates that objects should not expire.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Timeout resolution (in seconds)</strong><p>       Defines what the "resolution" of item timeout is. Setting this
       higher allows the transience machinery to do fewer "writes" at
       the expense of causing items to time out later than the "Data
       object timeout value" by a factor of (at most) this many
       seconds. This number must divide evenly into the number of
       timeout seconds ("Data object timeout value" * 60) and cannot
       be set higher than the timeout value in seconds.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Maximum number of subobjects </strong><p>       The maximum number of subobjects that this container may
       simultaneously hold. Since transient objects normally hold
       session data, this number is this is the effective limit for
       the number of simultaneous sessions.</p>
<p>       If the value is "0", the number of objects addable to the container
       will be not be artificially limited.</p>
<p>       Note: This setting is useful to prevent accidental or deliberate denial
       of service due to RAM shortage if the transient object container is
       instantiated in a storage which is backed solely by RAM, such
       as a Temporary Folder.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Script to call when objects are added</strong><p>       <em>Optional</em></p>
<p>       The physical path of of a Zope script which will receive notifications
       when objects are added to the Transient Object Container.</p>
<p>       Ex: <code>/path/to/add/script</code>.</p>
<p>       For more information, see "Add and Delete Scripts" below.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Script to call when objects are deleted</strong><p>       <em>Optional</em></p>
<p>       The physical path of a Zope script which will receive notifications
       when objects are deleted from the Transient Object Container, either
       explicitly or through timeout-related expiration.</p>
<p>       Ex: <code>/path/to/delete/script</code></p>
<p>       For more information, see "Add and Delete Scripts" below.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Add and Delete Scripts</h4>
<p>        Add and Delete scripts are Zope scripts which are called,
        respectively, when an object is added or removed from a
        Transient Object Container.   An add or delete script is specified
        by naming it by its full Zope object path with slash separators,
        e.g. "/path/to/method".</p>
<p>        Add and delete scripts are called with two arguments.  The first
        argument is the item being added or removed from the container;
        the second argument is the Transient Object Container itself.
        The container will be acquisition wrapped, allowing the
        it to be used as a context to reference other Zope objects.</p>
