<h3>Temporary Folders</h3>
<h4>  Overview </h4>
<p>    Temporary Folders are Folders which store their contents
    "in-memory", in much the same way as a RAM disk.  The contents
    of a Temporary Folder are lost upon shutdown.</p>
<h4>  Creating</h4>
<p>    By default, Zope will create a Temporary Folder named "temp_folder" in
    the root of every Zope installation.  This Temporary Folder will
    be used by the Zope Sessions machinery, but it may be used for
    other purposes as well.</p>
<p>    You may create additional Temporary Folders.  Creating a Temporary
    Folder is fairly straightfoward; they are created in the same way
    as a "regular" Folder through the Zope management interface:
<ul>
<li>Specify an id (a name) for the folder</li>
<li>Specify an optional title for the folder</li>

</ul>
</p>
<h4>  Usage</h4>
<p>    Once created, a Temporary Folder acts just like regular Folder
    object with the exception that the items which it contains will be
    lost upon Zope shutdown and restart.</p>
<p>    Since Temporary Folders use RAM to store data, it is advised to
    add items to a Temporary Folder sparingly.  The capacity of a
    Temporary Folder is limited by available RAM.</p>
<h4>  Interaction with ZEO</h4>
<p>    Temporary Folders exist local to the Zope server.  Thus, each
    server in a ZEO cluster would have their own private copy of data
    in a Temporary Folder.  Only temporary data that should be local
    to a specific Zope instance should go into a Temporary Folder.
    Items which need to be shared between Zope servers in a ZEO
    cluster should not be placed in Temporary Folders.</p>
