<h3>Security - Define security settings.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view allows you to define security settings.</p>
<p>    Security settings are defined in terms of <em>roles</em> and
    <em>permissions</em>. When a role is assigned to a permission users with
    the given role will be able to perform tasks associated with the
    permission on the object.</p>
<h4>  Controls</h4>
<h5>    Assign Roles to Permissions</h5>
<p>      Roles are listed in columns and permissions are listed in rows.
      To assign a role to a permission check the checkbox at the
      intersection of the row and column. You can also manage roles
      and permissions individually by clicking on their name links.</p>
<h5>    Create Roles</h5>
<p>      You can create new roles by entering the role name in the text
      entry field under the <code>User defined roles</code> heading and clicking
      the <code>Add Role</code> button. You can delete any existing user defined
      roles by selecting them from the selection list under the <code>User
      defined roles</code> heading and clicking the <code>Delete Role</code> button.</p>
<h5>    Local Roles</h5>
<p>      You can create and manage local roles by clicking the
      <code>local roles</code> link. </p>
<h5>    Assign Permissions to a Role</h5>
<p>      You can manage the permissions assigned to a role by clicking on
      the role name.</p>
<h5>    Assign Roles to a Permission</h5>
<p>      You can manage the roles assigned to a permission by clicking on
      the permission name.</p>
<h5>    Acquire Permissions</h5>
<p>      The <code>Acquire permission settings</code> check box next to each
      permission indicates whether this item should inherit security
      settings for this permission from its container object.  The
      acquired permission settings may be augmented by selecting roles
      for a permission in addition to selecting to acquire
      permissions.</p>
<p>      You can manage the acquisition of permission
      settings individually by clicking the <code>Acquire permission
      settings</code> link. </p>
