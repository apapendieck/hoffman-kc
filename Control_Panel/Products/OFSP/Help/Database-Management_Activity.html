<h3>Database Management - Activity</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view displays activity in the ZODB over a period of time.
    It shows how many objects were loaded and stored.  You can use
    this information to determine the optimal memory cache size for
    your Zope application.  You can also use it to discover
    applications that write to the database too often.</p>
<h4>  Information</h4>
<dl>
<dt>    <code>Keep History</code></dt>
<dd>Lets you define how many seconds of history
    to keep for analysis.  3600 is one hour.  86400 is one day.
    Note that in the current implementation, analysis data is
    kept only in memory and is never stored to disk, so each time
    you restart, you lose the historical information.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Displayed Range</code></dt>
<dd>Tells you what period of time is displayed
    by the chart.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Show current chart</code></dt>
<dd>Redisplays the chart for the current
    time.</dd>
</dl>
<p>    The chart contains a bar graph.  The rightmost bar shows the
    most recent activity.  The red portion indicates the number of
    objects stored and the blue portion indicates the number of
    objects loaded during that time period.  To the right of the
    graph there is a total.</p>
<p>    If you click on a bar, the chart will zoom in on the time
    period for just that bar.  You will see the details of the
    activity during that short time period.  Click the "Show current
    chart" button to return to the chart for the current time.</p>
<h4>  How to use this information</h4>
<p>    Once Zope has loaded enough objects, the ZODB cache consistently
    keeps in the cache the number of objects you specify under the
    "Cache Parameters" tab.  Because the cache size is so consistent
    and ZODB is so transparent to both the user and
    application developer, Zope applications can invisibly develop a
    performance problem by loading objects from ZODB on every request.</p>
<p>    Also, if the cache size is set too high, Zope will consume more
    RAM than it needs.  You need to find a good balance that fits
    your site.  If the bar chart shows a large number of objects being
    loaded all the time, increase the cache size, which will increase
    memory usage but should also increase performance.  If the
    chart shows little activity even though the site is visited
    frequently, you can reduce the cache size so Zope will consume less
    RAM.</p>
<p>    As your site changes, its cache size requirements may change also,
    so remember to make adjustments over time.</p>
<p>    If the graph shows a lot of writes (a significant portion of red),
    some application or product may be writing to the database too
    frequently.  Check the "undo" log for clues.  Note that the activity
    graph does not show activity in mounted databases, so objects loaded
    and stored by the sessioning machinery are not counted in the graph.</p>
