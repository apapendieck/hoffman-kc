<h3>Undo - Undo management actions.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view allows you to undo changes to Zope's database.</p>
<p>    Zope allows you to undo changes to its database. Changes are
    defined in terms of transactions which group together related
    changes. Each transaction has a URL and a user associated with
    it. In general the URL of a transaction indicates the URL that was
    called to initiate the changes.</p>
<p>    If an object was changed several times and you want to recover a
    version several changes back, you have to undo all the
    intermediary transactions as well.</p>
<h4>  Controls</h4>
<dl>
<dt>    <code>[Checkbox]</code></dt>
<dd>Selects one or more transactions. Each line shows one
    transaction. The transactions are sorted by date and time. The
    checkbox in the front allows you to check the transactions you
    would like to undo. The next entry on the line is the URL that
    caused the transaction, followed by the user who committed the
    transaction and the time transaction was performed.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Earlier Transactions</code></dt>
<dd>Allows you to see transactions that were
    performed earlier then the ones you currently see.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Later Transactions</code></dt>
<dd>Allows you to see transactions that were
    performed later then the ones you currently see.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Undo</code></dt>
<dd>Undo the selected transactions.</dd>
