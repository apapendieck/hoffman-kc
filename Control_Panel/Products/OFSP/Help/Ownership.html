<h3>Ownership: Manage ownership.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view allows you to set the ownership of an object.</p>
<p>    On the top of the page Zope will tell you whether the 
    object has an owner and who it is.</p>
<p>    All Zope objects except objects within the Control Panel support 
    ownership. When an object is created, copied or imported in Zope, 
    the logged-in user performing the operation becomes the owner of 
    the resulting object(s). Note that simply moving or renaming an 
    object does not change its ownership.</p>
<p>    Ownership is most important for Zope objects that "execute" 
    content supplied through the web, such as DTML Methods, DTML 
    Documents and SQL Methods. The abilities of these  executable 
    objects are constrained by the abilities of the object's owner
    as well as the user causing the object to execute from a Zope
    security point of view. In other words, an executable cannot 
    perform operations that its owner could not perform directly.</p>
<p>    While most Zope objects support ownership, objects may not always
    have an owner assigned. Objects that do not have an assigned owner
    are <em>unowned</em>. An unowned executable object executes with the
    permissions of the user running the object.</p>
<p>    It is possible to remove a user in your Zope installation while
    objects that were owned by that user remain (for instance, someone
    in your organization moves on, so you remove his account on your
    Zope server). When you remove a Zope user, objects that were owned
    by that user still have ownership information that refers to that
    user. This will not cause an error, but it is important to
    understand what happens to Zope objects whose owners no longer
    exist.  This is most important for "executable" objects. Usually,
    the abilities of executable objects are constrained by the
    abilities of the object's owner as well as the user causing the
    object to execute. If Zope cannot find the user that the
    executable's ownership information refers to when it tries to
    execute the object, it will use the special <code>nobody</code> or anonymous
    user instead. The <code>nobody</code> user has very minimal privileges, so
    you should take this into account when deciding what to do about a
    user's owned objects when you delete the user. If the user had
    DTML documents or other executable objects that depended upon
    their owner to have a higher level of privilege than the <code>nobody</code>
    user, they will not work correctly until their ownership has been
    reassigned to another user with sufficient privileges.</p>
<h4>  Controls</h4>
<dl>
<dt>    <code>Take ownership</code></dt>
<dd>Gives you ownership of this object.<p>      **Note: For this operation you have the <code>Take ownership</code> role.**</p>
</dd>
<dt>    <code>Also take ownership of all sub-objects</code></dt>
<dd>Gives you ownership of all the current object's sub-objects when you take ownership of the current object. Normally you should leave this option checked.</dd>
</dl>
