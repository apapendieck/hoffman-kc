<h3>Cache Management: Configurable Caching</h3>
<p>  Performing some computations in Zope can take a long time or use
  a lot of resources.  One way to deal with expensive tasks is to
  cache them.  The first time the computation is requested, the results
  are stored in a table or <em>cache</em>.  Subsequent requests get the results
  from the cache.  This can result in a dramatic speed increase.</p>
<p>  There are so many possible strategies for caching that no one could
  possibly come up with them all.  Caches can be
  stored in memory, on disk, on other computers, or by other means.
  Caches can be limited in size or unconstrained.  They can be
  made to work with only specific types of objects.  They can be
  tuned in different ways.</p>
<p>  So instead of trying to provide for every possible caching strategy,
  Zope defines an API called <em>cache management</em> that lets developers
  write their own caching strategies, or <em>cache managers</em>, and lets
  site administrators easily connect cacheable objects to those cache
  managers.</p>
<p>  You can use caching to speed up access to often-requested pages,
  reduce disk access and network traffic, and deal with heavy loads.
  All these benefits come with risks of excessive caching, however,
  so it's important to fine-tune the cache settings.  More on this
  later.</p>
<h3>How to set up caching</h3>
<p>  The first thing you need to do is create a cache manager instance.
  In the Zope management interface, go to a folder containing objects
  that would benefit from caching.  From the add list, select a
  cache manager type such as <code>RAM Cache Manager</code>.  Use an ID that
  describes the purpose of the cache manager.</p>
<p>  Next, visit one of the objects that you want to cache.  A new tab
  labeled <code>Cache</code> should be visible.  Select it.  From the drop-down
  box, select the cache manager you just created and press the
  <code>Change</code> button.</p>
<p>  The object is now ready to be cached.  Visit the <code>View</code> tab.  If
  the object is a script that takes a long time to render, the first
  view will still take just as long as before.  But if you're using
  a RAM cache manager or similar, the second view should be much faster.
  Press the <em>reload</em> button in your browser to try it out.</p>
<p>  You can associate many objects to a cache manager at once using the
  <code>Associate</code> tab of all cache managers.  Visit the cache manager
  object you created and select the <code>Associate</code> tab.  Press the
  <code>Locate</code> button.  Zope will locate all cacheable objects in the
  folder.  Select the checkboxes next to the objects you want to
  cache and press the <code>Save changes</code> button.</p>
<h3>Inherent risks</h3>
<p>  Cache managers generally don't know the nature of what is being
  cached, so here are some issues that can surface:
<ul>
<li>Data that is intended for authorized viewers only can
      be inadvertently cached in public caches.</li>
<li>Data is cached for too long a time.</li>
<li>If more than one cache is involved, data is purged from one
      cache but not the other.</li>
<li>A method that makes up part of the page sets the caching headers
      for the entire response, fooling downstream caches into thinking
      the whole response should be cached.</li>
<li>Result data can depend on any number of objects.  Early on it was
      decided that the standard cache managers will not try to deduce
      dependencies, but instead rely on the user for configuration of
      simple dependencies.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>  Because of these risks, you should be careful when setting up caching.
  You'll need to fine-tune the cache settings.  Sometimes you'll find
  that you can't cache one of your major pages, but that you can cache
  pieces of it.</p>
<p>  Also remember that caching can actually slow down Zope if it is
  applied unscrupulously.  You should perform speed tests to verify that
  caching really does speed up your site.</p>
