<h3>ZClass - Methods: Manage ZClass methods.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view allows you to manage ZClass methods.</p>
<p>    A ZClass inherits methods from its base classes. It can also
    contain methods which are managed through the web. This view
    allows you to create and edit methods such as DTML Methods, ZSQL
    Methods, and External Methods though the web. Methods that you
    create through the web will be accessible as methods on instances
    of the ZClass.</p>
<p>    The creation and management of methods proceeds exactly like the
    management of a Folder's contents. See "Folder - Contents".  The
    main difference between editing method objects and normal objects
    is that methods have a <code>Define Permissions</code> view in place of a
    <code>Security</code> view. See "Security - Define Permissions".</p>
<p>    If you create ZClasses inside the Methods view of a ZClass
    instances of the inner class will be addable to instances of the
    outer class. Typically the outer class will subclass
    <code>ObjectManager</code> and the inner class will be only relevant inside
    the outer class.</p>
