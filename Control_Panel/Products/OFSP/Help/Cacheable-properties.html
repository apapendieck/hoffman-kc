<h3>Cacheable objects</h3>
<p>  For background information, see the
  <a href="Caching.html">description of cache management</a>.</p>
<p>  The <code>Cache</code> tab allows you to associate a cacheable object with a
  cache manager.  It is only available when at least one cache manager
  exists somewhere in the current context.</p>
<p>  Use the drop-down box to select which cache manager should be
  associated with the object.  Some types of objects provide
  additional caching options.</p>
<p>  DTML methods can be cached according to the DTML namespace.  The entry
  box on the <code>Cache</code> tab allows you to enter the names
  (one per line) that Zope should look up in the namespace to create the
  cache key.  Note, however, that the namespace lookup operation can be
  expensive, so use this feature with care.  Also note that it is not
  possible for accelerated HTTP cache managers to make use of this feature.</p>
<p>  (TODO) Python scripts and SQL methods may also provide further options.</p>
