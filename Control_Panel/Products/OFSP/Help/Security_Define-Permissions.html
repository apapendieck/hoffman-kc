<h3>Security - Define Permissions: Map permissions.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    The "Define Permissions" view is used to define how the operations
    of this object (or objects that acquire permission settings from
    this object) correspond to the operations defined by your product
    or ZClass.</p>
<h5>    Permissions</h5>
<p>      Permissions are used to represent abstract operations or types of
      usage. A permission may correspond to many low-level object
      operations. Permissions provide a way to control access to
      operations without having to list each operation explicitly.</p>
<p>      When creating Products or ZClasses, we use high-level objects,
      like DTML Methods to define operations.  These high-level objects
      have their own permissions, which represent abstract operations on
      the low-level operations of these high-level objects.</p>
<p>      When defining permissions for our products and ZClasses we need
      to define what low-level operations these new permissions
      correspond to.  We could enumerate the low-level operations of
      the high-level objects used to implement the operations of our
      products or ZClasses, but this would be cumbersome, error prone,
      and likely to break as the interfaces of the high-level objects
      evolve.</p>
<p>      What we do instead is to treat the permissions of the high-level
      objects used to implement a Product or ZClass operations as the
      low-level operations that the product or ZClass operations
      abstract.</p>
<h4>  Controls</h4>
<p>    The view has a table with two columns. The first column lists the
    permissions for an object. The second column specifies the
    permissions that should have this permission in this product or
    ZClass. For ZClass methods only permissions that are defined for
    the ZClass are permitted.</p>
<p>    In general any permissions that include operations that change
    (mutate) an object should be disabled. Otherwise, a method could
    be modified when used on an instance, such as a ZClass instance.</p>
<p>    This interface is used to define how the operations of this object
    (or objects that acquire permission settings from this object)
    correspond to the operations defined by your product or ZClass.</p>
<p>    **Note: The <code>View</code> permission should be always mapped to the
    <code>View</code> permission, since every user, even <code>Anonymous User</code> has
    this permission.**</p>
<dl>
<dt>    <code>Permission for this object</code></dt>
<dd>The object permission to map.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Permissions that correspond to (i.e. have) this permission</code></dt>
<dd>The Product or ZClass permission to map to.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Change</code></dt>
<dd>Changes the permissions mapping.</dd>
