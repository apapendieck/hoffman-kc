<h3>Debug Information - Debugging Information: Online Zope debugging</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view provides simple debugging information to help product
    authors find memory leaks in their products as well as Zope
    itself.</p>
<h5>    Debugging Information</h5>

<ul>
<li>The Zope version</li>
<li>The Python version</li>
<li>The system platform name</li>
<li>The filesystem path of the Zope core software, add-on software,
        and data files.</li>
<li>The ID number of the Zope process (if available on your platform)</li>
<li>The length of time Zope has been running</li>
<li>The Python module search paths (sys.path).</li>
<li>The top refcounts, including a table listing the changes since
      * the last snapshot</li>
<li>The open object database connections</li>

</ul>
<p>      The Zope version, Python version, and system platform name are
      used to verify compatibility between Zope, Python, and your
      system.  On platforms where the process ID number is available,
      the Zope process can be managed using a more forceful means than
      is available through the web.</p>
<h5>    Refcounts</h5>
<p>      The top refcounts list lets you take a look at what is being
      stored by Zope in memory.  The scrollable list shows how many
      instances of each type of object are currently in memory.</p>
<p>      If there are items in the list with a very high refcount, there
      is a good chance there is a memory leak in a product or in Zope.
      Using the snapshot and refresh options allow you to determine
      which operations are causing memory leaks.</p>
<h5>    Open Connections</h5>
<p>      A database connection usually corresponds with an HTTP request.
      The left column shows the time at which the connection was
      opened.  If there is a request that has been running for a long
      time you may need to restart Zope to kill the corresponding
      thread. The middle column usually shows the state of the REQUEST
      object with size of the cache for that connection in
      parentheses.  The right column shows information about the
      version the user is working in.</p>
<h4>  Controls</h4>
<dl>
<dt>    <code>Update Snapshot</code></dt>
<dd>Takes the current refcounts and store them in
    memory.  Then each time the debugging page is reloaded, the table
    will show the difference in refcounts between the snapshot and the
    current state.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Refresh</code></dt>
<dd>Reloads and updates the debugging information.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Auto refresh interval</code></dt>
<dd>The number of seconds to wait before
    automatically refreshing the debugging information.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Start auto refresh</code></dt>
<dd>Begins automatically refreshing the
    debugging information.</dd>
<dt>    <code>Stop auto refresh</code></dt>
<dd>Ends automatic refreshing of the debugging
    information.</dd>
</dl>
