<h3>ObjectManager - Contents: Edit contained objects.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view displays the contained objects and allows you to add,
    delete and change them.</p>
<p>    Each contained object is displayed on a line and is identified by
    an icon, an id and a title in parenthesis. Additionally, the size
    (if applicable) and the date during which the object was last modified
    are displayed.  You can manage an object by clicking on its identifying
    link.</p>
<h5>    Sorting</h5>
<p>      You can sort contained objects by type, name (id), size, or modification
      date. To do so, click on the appropriate column heading. Clicking
      a second time on any column heading will reverse the sort on that
      field.</p>
<h5>    Versions</h5>
<p>      If you are currently working in a version there will be a
      notice at the top of the list of objects indicating this.</p>
<p>      If there is a red diamond following the name of an object this
      indicates that the object has been modified in the version you
      are currently working in. If there is a red diamond with a lock
      after an object, this indicates the the object has been modified
      in another version.</p>
<h4>  Controls</h4>
