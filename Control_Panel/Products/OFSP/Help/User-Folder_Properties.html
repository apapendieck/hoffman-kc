<h3>User Folder - Properties: Change properties of the user folder.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view allows you to change settings of a user folder.</p>
<h4>  Controls</h4>
<p>    The <code>Encrypt user passwords</code> checkbox controls whether user passwords
    are stored encrypted.  If passwords are stored encrypted, users can
    still use their password to log in but it is very difficult for anyone,
    especially intruders, to decrypt the passwords.  It also prevents
    system administrators from telling users what their current
    password is, although system administrators can still reset user
    passwords.</p>
<p>    If you click the <code>Update existing passwords</code> button while the
    <code>Encrypt user passwords</code> checkbox is on, Zope will encrypt all the
    unencrypted passwords of the users in the folder.  Zope uses the
    Secure Hash Algorithm so the encryption is irreversible.</p>
<p>    Note that you can still undo after updating the existing passwords
    because the unencrypted passwords are stored in the history in ZODB.
    After encrypting the passwords, you should pack the database then
    delete the temporary storage files created during packing.</p>
