<h3>ObjectManager with OrderSupport - Contents: Edit contained objects.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    This view displays the contained objects and allows you to add,
    delete, change and order them.</p>
<p>    Each contained object is displayed on a line and is identified by
    an icon, an id and a title in parenthesis. Additionally, the size
    (if applicable) and the date during which the object was last modified
    are displayed.  You can manage an object by clicking on its identifying
    link.</p>
<h5>    Sorting vs. Ordering</h5>
<p>      You can sort contained objects by type, name (id), size,
      modification date or by position (fixed order, see below). To do so,
      click on the appropriate column heading. Clicking a second time
      on any column heading (except position) will reverse the sort
      on that field. Sorting takes no actions on the contained
      objects, but will only change the users personal point of view.</p>
<p>      You can order contained objects with the controls on the bottom
      of the page. The order of objects (<code>sort by position</code>) is stored
      in the database and remains fixed until it is changed by another
      user.</p>
<h5>    Versions</h5>
<p>      If you are currently working in a version there will be a
      notice at the top of the list of objects indicating this.</p>
<p>      If there is a red diamond following the name of an object this
      indicates that the object has been modified in the version you
      are currently working in. If there is a red diamond with a lock
      after an object, this indicates the the object has been modified
      in another version.</p>
<h4>  Controls</h4>
