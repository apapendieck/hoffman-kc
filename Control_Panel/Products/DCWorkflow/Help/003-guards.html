<h3>Guards</h3>
<p>  Guard settings control access to the transitions, variables or work
  lists. Guards can be applied based on permissions, roles, groups or
  a TALES expression. These elements are applied sequentially if they
  contain values. If one of the conditions in each of the specified
  permissions, roles or groups is met the guard element will be
  satisfied. For the guard to allow access, all specified element that
  contain values must be satisfied.
  If no permissions, roles or expressions are specified, access is 
  automatically granted.</p>
<p>  You can supply several options in each field by separating them with
  a semicolon.</p>
<p>  The context in which the guards evaluate permissions and roles is
  obviously important. In the case of transitions and work lists, it 
  depends on the category. If it's <code>worklist</code>, then the context is 
  that of the content object, and local roles will behave just as
  you'd expect. If the category is <code>global</code>, then the context will be
  the site root, so the local roles between the site root and the
  content won't be considered.</p>
<p>  [<strong>Note:</strong> What about variables?]</p>
