<h3>Transitions Tab</h3>
<p> Transitions are the actions that move content from one state in the
 workflow to another. From the transitions tab it's possible to add new
 transitions, and rename and delete existing transitions.</p>
<p> The list of existing transitions also displays a summary of each
 transition's title, description, destination state, trigger, guards, 
 and action box entry. You can click through each transition to access 
 their details.</p>
<p> Within a transition's properties tab you can set the title, and 
 a collection of properties the define the transtion's behaviour, as
 follows:<dl>
<dt>  Destination state</dt>
<dd>selected from all the states defined in the 
  states tab. A transition can remain in state, which is useful for a
  reviewer adding comments to the review history, but not taking any
  action, updating some variable, or invoking scripts.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>  Trigger type - There are two types:</h4>

<ul>
<li>User actions are the familiar user initiated transitions activated
    by actions in the action box.</li>
<li>Automatic transitions are executed any time other workflow
    events occur; so if a user action results in the content moving
    to a state that has automatic transitions, they will be executed.
    (You should use mutually exclusive guards to prevent indeterminate
    behavior.)</li>

</ul>
<p>  Scripts - Perform complicated behaviours either before or after the
  transition takes place. Scripts of all kinds are defined in the
  workflow's scripts tab. Scripts called from here must accept only
  one argument; a <code>status_change</code> object. See Expressions for more
  details.</p>
<dl>
<dt>  Guards and Action boxes</dt>
<dd>See the "Guards" and "Action Boxes"
  sections for specific details about those fields. Note that
  automatic transitions don't need the action box fields to be filled out.</dd>
</dl>
<p>  What the action should link to.</p>
</p>
<p> In the transition's variables tab, you can add, change and delete
 variables that you want to assign a value to, when the transition is
 executed. The available variables are set in the workflow's variables
 tab, and the value is a TALES expression (see Expressions for more
 details).</p>
