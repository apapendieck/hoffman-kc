<h3>TALES Path expressions</h3>
<h4>  Syntax</h4>
<p>    Path expression syntax:
<pre>
      PathExpr  ::= Path [ '|' Path ]*
      Path      ::= variable [ '/' URL_Segment ]*
      variable  ::= Name
</pre>
</p>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    A path expression consists of one or more <em>paths</em> separated by
    vertical bars (|).  A path consists of one or more non-empty
    strings separated by slashes. The first string must be a variable
    name (built-in variable or a user defined variable), and the
    remaining strings, the <em>path segments</em>, may contain letters,
    digits, spaces, and the punctuation characters underscore, dash,
    period, comma, and tilde.</p>
<p>    For example:
<pre>
      request/cookies/oatmeal
      nothing
      here/some-file 2001_02.html.tar.gz/foo
      root/to/branch | default
      request/name | string:Anonymous Coward
</pre>
</p>
<p>    When a path expression is evaluated, Zope attempts to traverse the
    path, from left to right, until it succeeds or runs out of paths
    segments.  To traverse a path, it first fetches the object stored
    in the variable.  For each path segment, it traverses from the
    current object to the subobject named by the path
    segment. Subobjects are located according to standard Zope
    traversal rules (via getattr, getitem, or traversal hooks).</p>
<p>    Once a path has been successfully traversed, the resulting object
    is the value of the expression.  If it is a callable object, such
    as a method or template, it is called.</p>
<p>    If a traversal step fails, evaluation immediately proceeds to the next
    path.  If there are no further paths, an error results.</p>
<p>    The expression in a series of paths seperated by vertical bars can
    be any TALES expression. For example, <code>request/name |
    string:Anonymous Coward</code>. This is useful chiefly for providing
    default values such as strings and numbers which are not
    expressable as path expressions.</p>
<p>    If no path is given the result is <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>    Since every path must start with a variable name, you need a set
    of starting variables that you can use to find other objects and
    values.  See the <a href="tales.html">TALES overview</a> for a list of
    built-in variables.  Since variable names are looked up first in
    locals, then in globals, then in this list, these names act just
    like built-ins in Python; They are always available, but they can
    be shadowed by a global or local variable declaration. You can
    always access the built-in names explicitly by prefixing them with
    <em>CONTEXTS</em>. (e.g. CONTEXTS/root, CONTEXTS/nothing, etc).</p>
<h4>  Examples</h4>
<p>    Inserting a cookie variable or a property:
<pre>
      &lt;span tal:replace="request/cookies/pref | here/pref"&gt;
        preference
      &lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>    Inserting the user name:
<pre>
      &lt;p tal:content="user/getUserName"&gt;
        User name
      &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</p>
