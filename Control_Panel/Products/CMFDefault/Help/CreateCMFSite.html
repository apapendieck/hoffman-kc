<h3>Use Case: Create a CMF Site</h3>
<h4>  Actor</h4>

<ul>
<li>Site Manager</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Overview</h4>
<p>    The top-level concept in the CMF is the idea of a "CMF Site". A
    CMF site is a content-oriented Web site with specific business
    goals, workflows, collaborations and audiences (content
    consumers). </p>
<p>    The "CMF Site" object is used in Zope to represent and manage a
    CMF Web site. The CMF Site object acts as a container for site
    components and content, and provides interfaces for configuring
    the functionality of the site.</p>
<h4>  Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Site Manager is logged into the Zope Management Interface
      (ZMI) with a user ID having the "Add CMF Sites" permission
      at the desired location.</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Procedure</h4>

<ol>
<li> From the ZMI, select "CMF Site" from the add list and click
      the "Add" button. This will bring up the "Add CMF Site" Web
      form. The elements on the add form are:<dl>
<dt>      <strong>Id</strong></dt>
<dd>the id to be used for the new CMF Site object. This id
        will appear in URLs to the site and its subobjects. The id
        field is a required field.</dd>
<dt>      <strong>Title</strong></dt>
<dd>the title to be used for the new CMF Site object. The
        title provides a more human-friendly label for the site
        object.  Providing a title is optional, but recommended.</dd>
<dt>      <strong>Membership Source</strong></dt>
<dd>the source of member information to be used by the new CMF
        Site. The default for this field is "Create a new user
        folder in the CMF Site". This option will create a new
        User Folder in the CMF Site to be used as the source of
        member data.<p>        You may also select "I have an existing user folder and
        want to use it instead". In this case, the CMF Site will
        draw its member information from a User Folder that
        already exists in the Zope object heirarchy above the new
        CMF Site.</p>
</dd>
<dt>      <strong>Description</strong></dt>
<dd>a short description of the site. This description may be
        made available with syndicated content and may be used by
        some of the default user interface elements of the site.
        Providing a description is optional, but recommended.</dd>
</dl>
<p>      After completing the Web form, click the "Add" button to
      create the new CMF Site object.</p>
</li>
<li> After submitting the form, the right frame of the ZMI should
      contain an administrative "welcome" page of the new CMF
      site.  The welcome page provides links to:<dl>
<dt>      <strong>The site configuration form</strong></dt>
<dd>This form allows you manage sitewide policies and
        configuration options. This should be your first stop
        after creating a CMF Site object.</dd>
<dt>      <strong>The management interface</strong></dt>
<dd>The Zope management interface (ZMI) for CMF Site objects
        provides management-level access to the individual
        components of the site and provides for more advanced
        configuration options.</dd>
<dt>      <strong>The site home page</strong></dt>
<dd>The default homepage of the new CMF site.  This is what
        visitors and members of the site will initially see when
        they access the site through the Web.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li> Now that the basic CMF Site object has been created, you
      should visit the site configuration form to continue setting
      up the new site.</li>

</ol>
