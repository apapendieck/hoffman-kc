<h3>Use Case: Become A Site Member</h3>
<h4>  Actor</h4>

<ul>
<li>Site Visitor</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Overview</h4>
<p>    Becoming a member of a site allows you to access the additional 
    services of the site. Often this includes a personal online 
    work area (your "desktop"), the ability create and submit your 
    own content for publication and the ability to personalize the
    look and behavior of the site to better meet your needs. </p>
<p>    Note that different sites have different purposes, and the specific
    services available to site members depends on the choices of the 
    site administrators. By default, a CMF site provides members with a
    private "desktop", the ability to create certain types of basic 
    content and the ability to select the visual style of the site that
    they see.</p>
<h4>  Procedure</h4>

<ol>
<li> To become a member of a site, visit the site homepage and click on 
      the "Join" link in the menu located on the left side of the page.</li>
<li> Clicking the "Join" link will take you to a form. Complete
      the fields on the form and click the "Register" button to
      become a registered member of the site.</li>
<li> The exact information required by the registration form will
      vary from site to site. The form for a default CMF site
      requires visitors to provide at least a login name, a
      password and a valid email address to become a member. The
      default form also gives you an option to have the password
      you provided at registration time emailed to you for future
      reference.</li>
<li> After submitting the member registration form, you should
      see a page informing you that you have successfully been
      registered as a site member. This page also provides a link
      that you can use to log into the site immediately.</li>

</ol>
