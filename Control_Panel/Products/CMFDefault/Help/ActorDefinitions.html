<h3>CMF Actors</h3>
<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Site Manager</strong></dt>
<dd>This actor is responsible for implementing site policies
    such as security, workflow associations, metadata and
    syndication policies. The Site Manager is also responsible
    for the overall organizational structure of the site.  See
      <a href="Actor_SiteManager-2.html">Actor: Site Manager</a>.</dd>
<dt>  <strong>Membership Manager</strong></dt>
<dd>This actor is responsible for managing who has access to a
    site (particularly back-end line of business users), and
    controls the privileges and properties of users.  See
    <a href="Actor_MembershipManager-2.html">Actor: Membership Manager</a>.</dd>
<dt>  <strong>Site Developer</strong></dt>
<dd>This actor is responsible for implementing new
    functionality for a site and making changes to existing
    site capabilities. This is a "programmer" type of role, and
    users acting the Site Developer capacity are technical
    people.  See <a href="Actor_SiteDeveloper.html">Actor: Site Developer</a>.</dd>
<dt>  <strong>Add-on Developer</strong></dt>
<dd>This actor is responsible for implementing new
    functionality that is suitable for distribution to one or
    more sites. **  See <a href="Actor_AddOnDeveloper.html">Actor: Add-On
    Developer</a>.</dd>
<dt>  <strong>Site Designer</strong></dt>
<dd>The Site Designer is responsible for producing and
    maintaining the "look and feel" of a site. This includes
    graphics, layout, navigation and other human factors.  See
    <a href="Actor_SiteDesigner-2.html">Actor: Site Designer</a>.</dd>
<dt>  <strong>Workflow Designer</strong></dt>
<dd>The Workflow Designer is responsible for defining new
    workflows and customizing existing workflows to meet
    business goals.  See <a href="Actor_WorkflowDesigner.html">Actor: Workflow
    Designer</a>.</dd>
<dt>  <strong>Content Creator</strong></dt>
<dd>Content Creators are responsible for producing and
    maintaining the actual content of a site.  See <a href="Actor_ContentCreator-2.html">Actor:
    Content Creator</a>.</dd>
<dt>  <strong>Reviewer</strong></dt>
<dd>This actor is responsible for ensuring the quality and
    correctness of site content.  See <a href="Actor_Reviewer-2.html">Actor:
    Reviewer</a>.</dd>
<dt>  <strong>Site Visitor</strong></dt>
<dd>A Site Visitor is an "end user" of the site. The visitor
    may or may not have an identity known to the system.
    Visitors with a known identity are referred to as "Members"
    of the site, and often can do more on a site than visitors
    without a known identity ("Guests"). Member visitors often
    have a participatory role on the site. Site Visitors have
    some general goals that are applicable to most sites, but
    many of the specific goals and expectations of Site
    Visitors are dependent upon the specific CMF site.  See
    <a href="Actor_SiteVisitor-2.html">Actor: Site Visitor</a>.</dd>
