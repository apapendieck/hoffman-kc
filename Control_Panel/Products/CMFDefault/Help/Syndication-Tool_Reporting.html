<h3>SyndicationTool - Overview: CMF Syndication Reporting Facility.</h3>
<h4>  Description</h4>
<p>    The SyndicationTool Reporting Facility is planned to be added to 
    the next release of the Syndication services for the CMF.
    I hope to have generated enough feedback from users who might have
    definate ideas which would make a good foundation as a default 
    suite of reports.  The plan is not to be all inclusive, but to 
    provide a mechanism to generate interesting SiteAdmin data regarding
    the use of Syndication within their sites.</p>
