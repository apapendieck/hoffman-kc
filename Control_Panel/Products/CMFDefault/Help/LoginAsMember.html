<h3>Use Case: Login To The Site</h3>
<h4>  Actor</h4>

<h4>  Overview</h4>
<p>    Visitors to a site who have registered as members must login to the
    site to use member-only services.</p>
<h4>  Procedure</h4>

<ol>
<li> Visit the homepage of the site and click the "Log in" link on the
       menu (located at the left of the page in a default CMF site).<p>       The "Log in" link will take you to a form where you may
       enter your username and password for the site. You may also
       select the "remember my name" checkbox and the site will
       fill in your username on the form for you the next time you
       login.</p>
</li>
<li> Once you have entered your name and password, click the
       "Login" button to login to the site. You should then see a
       message letting you know that you have been successfully
       logged in. If you did not type your username or password
       correctly, you will see a page telling you that the login
       did not succeed.</li>

</ol>
