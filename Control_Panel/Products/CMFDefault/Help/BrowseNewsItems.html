<h3>Use Case:  Browse community news</h3>
<h4>  Actor</h4>

<ul>
<li>Site Visitor</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Overview</h4>
<p>    Visitors to a CMF Site will typically return to the site after
    an initial visit only if the site's content was interesting or
    valuable to them.  They will return often to the site only if
    they perceive that this interesting and valuable content is
    being frequently updated.  This use case deals with the most
    common "dynamic" feature of a CMF Site:  its list of published
    News Items.</p>
<h4>  Procedure</h4>

<ol>
<li>  Select the <code>news</code> link from the navigation bar.  The system
        will display the ten most recent News Items, sorted in
        descending date order.  If there are more than ten
        published News Items, the system will display a link to
        the next batch at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>  Navigate between batches of News Items by clicking the
        "10 older artcles" and "10 newer articles" links.</li>

</ol>
