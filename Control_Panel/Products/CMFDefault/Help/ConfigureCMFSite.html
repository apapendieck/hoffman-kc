<h3>Use Case: Configuring a CMF site</h3>
<h4>  Actor</h4>

<ul>
<li>Site Manager</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Overview</h4>
<p>    The "site configuration form" of a CMF Site object provides a simple 
    way to set and change the sitewide configuration options and policies 
    for a CMF site. Theses options include some of the information that was 
    provided when the CMF Site was created (such as site title and 
    description), as well as other options that were given defaults when 
    the CMF site was created.</p>
<h4>  Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Site Manager has logged into the CMF site using a user ID
      wtih the "Change configuration" permission (see <a href="LoginAsMember-2.html">Login to the
      Site</a>).</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Procedure</h4>

<ol>
<li> Site Managers see a "Reconfigure site" link in the actions box. 
      Click the "Reconfigure site" link to bring up the site configuration 
      form.<p>      The configuration options available from the site configuration form
      are:<dl>
<dt>        **Site <code>From</code> Name**</dt>
<dd>The name to be used as the
          (apparent) sender when the site generates email. The
          site may generate email to provide information to new
          members, or to notify members of various events. The
          default value for this name is <code>Site Administrator</code>. A
          value for this field is required in order to send mail
          from the site.</dd>
<dt>        **Site <code>From</code> Address**</dt>
<dd>The email address used as the
          (apparent) return address when the site generates email.
          The default value for the from address is
          <code>postmaster@localhost</code>. A value for this field is
          required in order to send mail from the site.</dd>
<dt>        <strong>SMTP Server</strong></dt>
<dd>The address of the SMTP (outgoing
          mail) server to be used when the site generates email.
          The default value for the SMTP server address is
          <code>localhost</code>, which presumes that you have an SMTP server
          running on the same machine as the Zope software. A
          valid SMTP server address is required in order to send
          mail from the site.</dd>
<dt>        <strong>Site Title</strong></dt>
<dd>The title of the site that appears at
          the top of all site pages (when using the default site
          skins). Providing a title is optional, but recommended.</dd>
<dt>        <strong>Site Description</strong></dt>
<dd>A short description of the site.
          This description may be made available with syndicated
          content and may be used by some of the default user
          interface elements of the site.  Providing a description
          is optional, but recommended.</dd>
<dt>        <strong>Password Policy</strong></dt>
<dd>The password policy configuration
          option allows you to choose the way that the site
          handles passwords when members register with the site.<p>          If you select "Generate an email member's initial
          password" the site will randomly generate an initial
          password that members must use to log into the site and
          email that password to the address provided by the
          member. This option may be preferred if you want to
          verify a prospective member's email address before
          granting membership to the site.</p>
<p>          If you select "Allow members to select their initial
          password" (the default), the site will allow new members
          to enter their own password at registration time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>      After making changes to the site configuration options,
      click the "Change" button to save the changes.</p>
