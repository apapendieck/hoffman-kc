<h3>Use Case:  Undo Changes to Content</h3>
<h4>  Actor</h4>

<ul>
<li>Content Creator</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Content Creator has logged into the CMF (see <a href="LoginAsMember-2.html">Login to the
      Site</a>).</li>
<li>Content Creator has made changes to content which she wishes
      to undo (see <a href="ChangeContent-2.html">Update existing content</a>).</li>
<li>The changes are "undoable"<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Procedure</h4>

<ol>
<li> Select <code>Undo</code> from the actions box.  The system will present
      a list of the transactions which you have permission to undo.</li>
<li> Select the checkbox next to the transaction which you wish to
      undo and click the undo button.  The system will undo that
      transaction and redisplay the list of transactions.</li>

</ol>
<p>  Notes</p>
<p>  ..<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> Transactions which involve changing content remain undoable
        until one or more objects modified by the transaction are 
        modified by a subsequent transaction.  Normally, this means
        that only the latest transaction to an object is undoable,
        unless the later transactions are also undone.<p>        It is also possible to have transactions above the
        transaction in the list which do not effect the ability to
        undo a change a user wishes to undo.</p>
