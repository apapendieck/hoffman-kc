<h3>Use Case:  Move / copy content between folders</h3>
<h4>  Actor</h4>

<ul>
<li>Content Creator</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Content Creator has logged into the CMF (see <a href="LoginAsMember-2.html">Login to the
      Site</a>).</li>

</ul>
<h4>  Procedure</h4>

<ol>
<li> Navigate to the folder containing the piece of content which
       you would like to move (or copy) to another folder.<p>       To retrieve a list of the content you have authored, see
       <a href="ViewMyContent-2.html">View personally authored content</a></p>
</li>
<li> In the "Folder contents" view of the folder, check the box next to
       the content object(s) which you would like to move or copy.</li>
<li> Click the "Cut" button (or the "Copy" button, if you wish to create
       a copy in the new location rather than moving the content).</li>
<li> The system will set a cookie on your browser (you must have cookies
       enabled) representing the items you cut or copied.</li>
<li> Navigate to the folder into which you wish to move or copy the
       content (which might be the same folder).</li>
<li> Click the "Paste" button.  The system will move or copy the content
       into the folder;  new content whose IDs would conflict with exising
       content in that folder will receive an auto-generated name, typically
       <code>copy_of_</code> plus the original ID.</li>
<li> To undo this action, see <a href="UndoChanges-2.html">Undo changes to content</a>.</li>

</ol>
