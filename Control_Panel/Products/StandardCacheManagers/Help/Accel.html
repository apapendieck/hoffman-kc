<h3>  Accelerated HTTP Cache Managers</h3>
<p>    For background information, see the
    <a href="../../OFSP/Help/Caching.html">description of cache management</a>.</p>
<p>    The HTTP protocol provides for headers that can indicate to
    downstream proxy caches, browser caches, and dedicated caches that
    certain documents and images are cacheable.  Most images, for example,
    can safely be cached for a long time.  Anonymous visits to most
    primary pages can be cached as well.</p>
<p>    An accelerated HTTP cache manager lets you control the headers that
    get sent with the responses to requests so that downstream caches
    will know what to cache and for how long.  This allows you to reduce
    the traffic to your site and handle larger loads than otherwise
    possible.  You can associate accelerated HTTP cache managers with
    any kind of cacheable object that can be viewed through the web.</p>
<p>    The main risk in using an accelerated HTTP cache manager involves
    a part of a page setting headers that apply to the whole response.
    If, for example, your home page contains three parts that are
    cacheable and one of those parts is associated with an accelerated
    HTTP cache manager, Zope will return the headers set by the part of
    the page, making downstream caches think that the whole page should
    be cached.</p>
<p>    The workaround is simple: don't use an accelerated HTTP cache manager
    with objects that make up parts of a page unless you really know
    what you're doing.</p>
<p>    There are some parameters available for accelerated HTTP cache managers.
    The interval is the number of seconds the downstream caches should
    cache the object.  3600 seconds, or one hour, is a good default.
    If you find that some objects need one interval and other objects
    should be set to another interval, use multiple cache managers.</p>
<p>    If you set the <em>cache anonymous connections only</em> checkbox, you
    will reduce the possibility of caching private data.</p>
<p>    The <em>notify URLs</em> parameter allows you to specify the URLs of
    specific downstream caches so they can receive invalidation messages
    as <code>PURGE</code> directives.  Dedicated HTTP cache software such
    as Squid will clear cached data for a given URL when receiving the
    <code>PURGE</code> directive.  (More details below.)</p>
<p>    Simple statistics are provided.  Remember that the only time Zope
    receives a request that goes through an HTTP cache is when the
    HTTP cache had a <em>miss</em>.  So the hits seen by Zope correspond to
    misses seen by the HTTP cache.  To do traffic analysis, you should
    consult the downstream HTTP caches.</p>
<p>    When testing the accelerated HTTP cache manager, keep in mind that
    the <em>reload</em> button on most browsers causes the <code>Pragma: no-cache</code>
    header to be sent, forcing HTTP caches to reload the page as well.
    Try using telnet, netcat, or tcpwatch to observe the headers.</p>
<p>    To allow Zope to execute the Squid PURGE directive, make sure the
    following lines or the equivalent are in squid.conf (changing
    <code>localhost</code> to the correct host name if Squid is on a different
    machine)::</p>
<p>      acl PURGE method purge
      http_access allow localhost
      http_access allow purge localhost
      http_access deny purge
      http_access deny all</p>
