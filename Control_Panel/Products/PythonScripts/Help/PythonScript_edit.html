<h3>Edit View: Edit A Script (Python)</h3>
<h4>    Description</h4>
<p>        This view allows you to edit the logic which composes a script
        in Python.  Script instances execute in a restricted
        context, bounded by your user's privilege level in Zope, and
        certain global restrictions of all through-the-web code.  For
        information about what you "can" and "cannot" do in a Script
        instance as opposed to non-through-the-web Python,
        see the API Reference documentation for "Script (Python)" in
        this help system.</p>
<h4>    Controls</h4>
<dl>
<dt>        <code>Title</code></dt>
<dd>Allows you to specify the Zope title of the script.</dd>
<dt>        <code>Id</code></dt>
<dd>Allows you to specify the id of the script.</dd>
<dt>        <code>Parameter List</code></dt>
<dd>Enter function parameters for this script
          separated by commas.  For example: <em>foo, bar, baz</em></dd>
</dl>
<h4>    Status Elements</h4>
<dl>
<dt>        <code>Bound Names</code></dt>
<dd>the names used by this script for bindings.
         You may use these names in the body of the script to refer to
         bound elements.  The defaults are:
<pre>
          context -- the script's "parent" respective to acquisition.

          container -- the script's "parent" respective to containment.

          script -- the script object itself.

          traverse_subpath -- if the script is called directly from a URL,
           this is the portion of the URL path after the script's name,
           split at slash separators, into a list of strings.  If the script
           was not called directly from a URL, this will be an empty list.
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>         Another possible name binding, to the "namespace" object, is
         not set by default.  If this was set, if the Script was
         called from DTML, it would represent the namespace of the
         calling DTML object.</p>
<p>         More information about bindings can be found by visiting the
         help screens of the "Bindings" tab of a Script (Python)
         instance.</p>
<h4>   Buttons and Other Form Elements</h4>
<dl>
<dt>        <code>Save Changes</code></dt>
<dd>saves changes you make to the body, title, or
          parameter list.</dd>
<dt>        <code>Taller</code>/<code>Shorter</code>/<code>Wider</code>/<code>Narrower</code></dt>
<dd>make the body textarea
          taller, shorter, wider, or narrower.</dd>
<dt>        <code>File</code></dt>
<dd>upload a file into this Script (Python) instance.</dd>
</dl>
<h5>   File Upload Details</h5>
<p>        Files uploaded into a Script (Python) instance may either
        consist only of the actual body of the function, or the file
        containing the function body may contain at its head a set of
        lines starting with "##" which describe bindings, parameters,
        and the title.  For example, a file uploaded into a Script
        (Python) instance might be simply:
<pre>
            return "Hello"
</pre>
</p>
<p>        If you upload this file into a Script (Python) instance, the
        existing settings (or default settings) for bindings,
        parameters, and title will remain.</p>
<p>        However, if you wished to, you could develop a Script (Python)
        on disk which looked like:
<pre>
            ## Script (Python) "foo"
            ##bind container=container
            ##bind context=context
            ##bind namespace=
            ##bind script=script
            ##bind subpath=traverse_subpath
            ##parameters=goop, fudge
            ##title=
            ##
            return "Fudge was %s, goop was %s" % (fudge, goop)
</pre>
</p>
<p>        The lines preceded by "##" are metadata about the Script
        (Python) instance which can survive a round trip via FTP or
        through the web interface.  When these lines are encountered
        by the parser after an upload (or webform save), they serve to
        <em>modify</em> the settings of the Script (Python) instance with the
        metadata contained within the blocked area.</p>
<p>        Lines beginning with "##" without any spaces after the "##"
        are contextually meaningful to the file upload parser.  There
        are three keywords which can directly follow a "##": "bind",
        "parameters", and "title".</p>
<p>        The "bind" keyword following a "##" binds a name to a object
        in the context this Script (Python) instance's body.  For
        example, the line "##bind container=goober" binds the name
        "goober" to the acquisition parent of the script, allowing you
        to refer to "goober" in the script body.  Legal objects to
        which to bind are: container, context, namespace, script, and
        subpath.  See the help available from the "bindings" tab of
        Script (Python) instances for more details about what bindings
        mean.</p>
<p>        The "title" keyword following a "##" provides a title to the
        script.  E.g. "title=A Really Neat Script"</p>
<p>        The "parameters" keyword following a "##" provides parameters
        to the Script (Python) instance.  E.g. "parameters=foo,bar,baz".</p>
