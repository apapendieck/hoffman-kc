ew Orleans has for decades suffered from<br>
New Orleans faces multiple structural, legal and admin-<br>
pervasive blight. Hurricane Katrina and the<br>
istrative problems in addressing blight. They include the<br>
Nresulting levee failures exacerbated this following:<br>

severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina. It is safe to say<br>that there are tens of thousands of blighted properties in<br>

<i>BGR conducted interviews with numerous profes-</i><br>

with blight remediation in the city, acquired and redevel-<br>oped only a few hundred properties annually.2 Post-<br>

BGR has previously made preliminary observations<br>
<i>BGR reviewed reports and academic papers regard-</i><br>

regarding the City’s blighted property programs. These<br>
<i>including reports on New Orleans and the cities list-</i><br>
observations appear in December 2007 letters sent to<br>
<i>ed below. BGR reviewed numerous documents and</i><br>
NORA and the City’s Office of Recovery Management<br>
<i>materials it obtained from NORA and the City.</i><br>
(ORM).4 This study builds on BGR’s initial observa-<br>tions, discussing the obstacles to blight remediation and<br>
<i>In addition to New Orleans’ programs, BGR’s research</i><br>
proposed solutions in greater detail.<br>

<i>Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Louisville,</i><br>
BGR uses the terms “blight” and “blighted” to refer to<br>
<i>Richmond, Genesee County (containing Flint, Mich.)</i><br>
severely dilapidated or damaged properties, regardless of<br>
<i>and Baltimore.</i><br>
whether such properties have been formally designated<br>as “blighted” under a local government process.<br>
<i>BGR also conducted physical surveys of hundreds of</i><br>
<i>properties that NORA acquired.7</i><br>
