<A name=2></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br>
There’s a lot of confusion surrounding the issue of flood elevations and what it <br>means to us homeowners, in the aftermath of the flooding.  However, the <br>information is available so you can make the best decision for your situation.  In <br>this packet I have assembled a lot of the information and documents gathered <br>during my own experience raising my house in Orleans Parish using ICC money.  <br>This packet is intended as a roadmap to homeowners who either may be <br>required to elevate, or who are considering elevating/raising their property.  It <br>may not cover every scenario, but it wil  help you to be better informed.  I <br>apologize in advance for any minor errors or omissions. I’ve tried to cover all the <br>information I understand to be correct for Orleans Parish property owners at the <br>time of writing.  Think of this as advice one citizen might give another in these <br>trying times.  If this packet is valuable to people, I wil  try to update and expand it <br>as and when I have time. <br> <br>Best of luck, <br>AH <br> <br>
PLEASE NOTE:  I AM AN ORDINARY CITIZEN TRYING TO HELP OTHERS.  I <br>CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION <br>IN THIS PACKET, AND CANNOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR THE POSSIBLE  <br>CONSEQUENCES OF ANY FACTUAL ERROR. THE INFORMATION IN THIS <br>PACKET IS FOR GUIDANCE ONLY.  IF YOU QUESTION ANY INFORMATION <br>INCLUDED HERE, HAVE IT CONFIRMED BY THE PROPER AUTHORITY <br>BEFORE YOU RELY ON IT TO ENTER INTO ANY LEGAL OBLIGATION. <br>

<A name=3></a>QUICK SUMMARY<br>
Homeowners who have flood insurance issued under the National Flood <br>Insurance Program (NFIP), AND whose home or property was, according to the <br>City, “substantially damaged” by the post-Katrina flooding: <br>
 <br>1) must bring their home or property into compliance with the City’s Flood <br>Plain Management Ordinance (“Code”) if they intend to rebuild, and  <br> <br>2) can apply through their insurance carrier to obtain ICC funds up to <br>$30,000 to cover the cost to comply with the City code in raising their <br>home or property to meet minimum BFE as established by their Flood <br>Elevation Certificate.  Once your ICC claim is approved, you have up to 2 <br>years to complete the work. To raise your home or property, you must <br>obtain a building permit from the City before any work begins.   <br>
 <br>Once you’ve raised your property to BFE, your insurance premiums should be <br>significantly lower than if you are below BFE.  You may even get insurance <br>where others below BFE wil  be refused coverage or offered coverage only at <br>very high premiums and/or stringent terms. <br> <br>
<b>NOTE</b>: I understand that many properties and homes damaged by post-Katrina <br>flooding are much larger than mine, and/or are of slab construction.  These <br>properties can present a more complex and more expensive operation to raise <br>them up, particularly by several feet.  It can be done, if necessary.  The fact that <br>you must ALWAYS keep in mind is that the ICC cap is $30,000 per claim.  In the <br>business of raising houses professionally, $30,000 does not go very far.  <br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>NOT-SO-QUICK, BUT MORE DETAILED SUMMARY<br>
If you live in a FEMA-designated Flood Zone and have a flood insurance <br>
policy issued under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), then when <br>certain conditions are met you are eligible to funds to raise your house (among <br>other options) to comply with the City’s Flood Plain Management ordinance <br>(“Code”).  The funds are available through the Federal government program, the <br>NFIP, which in turn is a part of FEMA.  Orleans Parish is a community that <br>participates in the NFIP program.  NFIP flood insurance is issued and <br>administered by certain commercial insurance carriers. The name given to the <br>funding is ICC, or, Increased Cost of Compliance.  The application process is <br>administered by your flood insurance carrier, using procedures established by <br>Federal law.  Every insurance carrier must follow the same ICC application and <br>funding steps.  ICC funding pays for a number of “measures” intended to mitigate <br>the risk of future flood losses, including raising your house, demolishing or <br>moving your house, up to a maximum of $30,000.  Aside from what is called a <br>“repetitive loss,” one of the more common situations that triggers the availability <br>of ICC funds is “substantial damage,” or, in other words, the need for “substantial <br>improvement” to your property. <br> <br>
You’ve probably heard the phrase “substantial damage” already.  That’s <br>
because the City code on Flood Plain Management is closely parallel to Federal <br>law regarding Flood Plain Management.  The City, not the Federal government or <br>the insurance carrier, decides whether or not property is “substantially damaged” <br>and/or needs “substantial improvement.”   <br> <br>
“Substantially damaged” basically means that your home or property has <br>
sustained flood damage in excess of 50% of its pre-flood value.  The City is <br>making this determination by an inspection of your home or property.  The <br>inspection takes into consideration the type of property (eg, single story wood <br>frame) and the damage sustained – measured in terms of percentage damage to <br>different parts of your house, and then calculated to an overall, single percentage <br>value. This is not a perfect science, as the City will acknowledge. There is some <br>‘wiggle’ room. When the inspection is complete, the city will issue you with a <br>report (also available online) that states whether your damage falls above or <br>below the 50% mark.  If your home or property has sustained “substantial <br>damage,” (ie., above 50%), the City wil  require, in the event you decide to <br>rebuild, that you ensure your house is in compliance with the City’s Flood Plain <br>Management code.  If you have a flood insurance policy issued under the NFIP, <br>then you can apply for ICC funds to cover the cost of the work needed to comply <br>with the City code, up to a maximum of $30,000. <br> <br>
The key to understanding what work wil  be required to comply with the <br>
City code is the term “Base Flood Elevation” (BFE).  Base Flood Elevation is a <br>

<A name=5></a>number (for example +1.5 feet) set by FEMA for each Flood Zone, such as A08.  <br>You can find the Flood Zone for your neighborhood by referring to the Flood <br>Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) issued by FEMA.  Alternatively, you can find the <br>same number on your Flood Elevation Certificate if you have one.  BFE is <br>basically how high the top of your bottom floor (the ground floor walking surface) <br>should be from the ground to avoid the likely damage to your home or property <br>from a 100-year flooding event.  Don’t worry about how meaningless this number <br>is compared to the height of the post-Katrina flooding.  That’s FEMA for you, <br>right?  It IS important, however, if you want to get ICC money to raise your <br>house.  <br> <br>
Orleans Parish requires that all new construction, or property that is to <br>
undergo “substantial improvement” (the mirror of “substantial damage”) be <br>elevated to “at or above the base flood elevation [BFE].”   The question is, how <br>do you know whether you are at or above BFE, or even whether you are <i>below</i> <br>BFE??  One answer is to look to your Flood Elevation Certificate.  Not everyone <br>wil  have one, at least not since the flooding wiped you out.  A Flood Elevation <br>Certificate is a document issued by a land surveyor.  These surveys are most <br>often conducted when you buy a house in a FEMA-designated flood zone. That’s <br>because FEMA requires that property located in a designated flood zone be flood <br>insured. The most important piece of information that the Flood Elevation <br>Certificate tells you is how much higher or lower your property is <i>relative to</i> BFE.  <br>For example, the BFE for your flood zone may be +1.5ft, but your “Top of Bottom <br>Floor” elevation may be -0.5ft.  If so, your home or property is 2 feet below BFE.<br>If your home or property is below BFE, and your home or property is <br>“substantially damaged,” you wil  need to raise your house to “at or above BFE” <br>to comply with City code if you rebuild.  You can apply for ICC funds to pay for <br>the cost of the work required to raise your house up to the minimum BFE.<br><b>Important</b>: in almost all cases, ICC money is not available to raise your house <br>by an amount <i>above</i> BFE.  If you want to go higher than minimum BFE, you must <br>pay the additional cost.  If you don’t have access to your Flood Elevation <br>Certificate, or if you’re not sure you have one, don’t worry about that yet.  Read <br>on, and I’l  explain. <br> <br><b>NOTE</b>: Although raising your house is a major project, there are two big <br>advantages.  First, for those with NFIP flood insurance and substantial damage <br>to their house, ICC funds wil  pay for the work, up to a maximum of $30,000.  <br>Second, <b>property elevated to or above BFE is substantially less expensive <br>to insure against flood </b>than is property sitting below BFE. <br> <br>

<A name=6></a><b>THE STEPS YOU NEED TO TAKE </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
1.  <b>FIND OUT IF YOUR HOME OR PROPERTY IS “SUBSTANTIALLY </b><br>
<b>DAMAGED.”  </b>Either: <br>
a.  The City has conducted an inspection of your property.  If your <br>
property received a so-called yellow sticker, the City has <br>designated your home or property as “substantially damaged.”  <br>Their report is available online at http://www cityofno.com by <br>following the links to Safety and Permits, or from the Safety and <br>Permits Office on the 7th Floor of City Hall.  Enter on Poydras <br>Street.  If you go to City Hall, be prepared for a long wait—up to an <br>hour.  The phone number is 658 7130 but only messages are <br>taken.  You wil  not be able to speak to a live person. <br>
 <br>b.  The City has not yet conducted an inspection.  You can request an <br>
inspection by the City to determine if your home or property is <br>“substantially damaged.”  Your best option is to visit the Safety and <br>Permits Office (see above).   Be prepared to wait up to a week for a <br>City Inspector to come out and inspect your property. <br>
 <br>
c.  The City has conducted an inspection and you do not agree with <br>
their determination.  Request another inspection by the City and try <br>to be there at the time the inspector visits the property.  Ask for the <br>name of the individual inspector and/or what date and time they wil  <br>make their inspection.  The City officials are doing their best to <br>accommodate property owners as best they can.  Be assertive but <br>polite. <br>
 <br>
If your property is not “substantially damaged,” you need not take any action <br>to comply with the City’s Flood Management Ordinance.  In that case, you are <br>not required to raise your house to BFE, and you wil  not be qualified to <br>receive ICC funds to raise your house if you choose to do so.   Any <br>reconstruction work you undertake probably wil  stil  need a permit, but that’s <br>beyond our subject here. <br> <br>If your property is “substantially damaged.” then the City wil  issue a letter <br>stating that fact.  You can ask them to mail it to you, have it left at your <br>property address, or you can pick the letter up personally from the office.  You <br>may also print out the report from the City’s website. The method you choose <br>wil  depend on how soon you need the letter.  As a result of the determination, <br>you wil  be required to bring your home or property into compliance with the <br>City’s Flood Management Ordinance if you rebuild.  That means your home or <br>property must then be “at or above base flood elevation [BFE].”  <br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a><hr>
<A name=8></a><b>2.  FIND OUT IF YOUR HOUSE IS “AT OR ABOVE” BFE. <br></b> <br>
a.  <b>If you have a Flood Elevation Certificate</b>, you now need to find it <br>
and examine it.  The Certificate wil  give you two key pieces of <br>information.  First, it wil  tell you the BFE for the Flood Zone in <br>which your home or property is located.  In my zone, A08, it is 1.5 <br>feet.  FEMA establishes this number.  It might change in the future <br>but for now it’s fixed. Second, it wil  tell you the elevation of the Top <br>of the Bottom Floor for your home or property.  This is essentially <br>the height above ground of your ground floor.  This number may be <br>either a positive or negative number.  If your Top of Bottom Floor is <br>less than the BFE, then you are below BFE.  If it’s the same as, or <br>greater than the BFE, you’re “at or above” BFE and are already in <br>compliance with code and need not raise your property.  If you are <br>just a few inches below BFE, it would be a good idea to discuss this <br>with a Safety and Permits officer.  They may allow you to remain at <br>that elevation, if you don’t otherwise want to raise your home.  <br>NOTE: when calculating insurance premiums, your flood insurance <br>carrier wil  round up any number over 6 inches, so if you’re four <br>inches or less below BFE, the insurance premium wil  be set as if <br>you were at BFE. <br>
 <br><b>Note: </b>There was a report in the Times-Picayune on Monday, <br>December 5th reporting that properties in this area are actually lower <br>than reported on Flood Elevation Certificates as a result of land <br>subsidence.  This means that your Top of Bottom Floor elevation is <br>almost certainly lower than it was at the time of the Flood Elevation <br>survey.  Like me, you may ask what is the correct figure, and wil  the <br>City stil  accept the figure on my Flood Elevation Certificate?  The <br>answer to the second part of the question is ‘Yes,’ the City wil  take the <br>figure on your Certificate as valid, even though it almost certainly isn’t <br>accurate.  That’s important if you don’t want to take the additional step <br>of determining the actual Top of Bottom Floor elevation as it is today.  <br>If the City considers the figure valid, then so wil  the insurance <br>company when it comes to processing your ICC claim.  <br> <br>Nevertheless, it is important to consider hiring a surveyor to conduct a <br>new survey.  In our city, being higher is better where flooding is <br>concerned.  To rely on old elevations is to leave your property lower <br>than it could be. You might at least lessen flood damage in the future <br>by being a little higher.  A new Flood Elevation Certificate may find you <br>lower than you were, but it also gives you the opportunity to raise your <br>house a little closer to the high water mark left by Katrina.   Call a local <br>land surveyor and explain your situation.  They should be able to tell <br>
<hr>
<A name=9></a>you if it is possible to establish accurate elevation data for your <br>property.  If you’re already below BFE, I would suggest getting a new, <br>accurate Flood Elevation Certificate before taking any action to raise <br>your property. <br> <br><b>NOTE</b>: There is a FEMA representative in the Safety and Permits <br>office at City Hall.  He is knowledgeable about ICC/NFIP issues and is <br>a really nice guy.  His name is John Messerol.  Ask at the front desk to <br>speak to him if you have any questions about the ICC program. <br> <br>
<b>b.  If you don’t have a flood elevation certificate</b><br>
There are three scenarios I can think of.  First, the City may have a <br>
record of the last flood survey figures that were done for your property.  <br>The best thing to do is to tell the Safety and Permits office that you do <br>not have a copy of your current Certificate ask them how to proceed.    <br>Second, you can arrange with a qualified land surveyor to conduct a <br>new survey and issue a new certificate.  The cost for this service <br>should be around $300 and you can submit the receipt for <br>reimbursement with your ICC claim.  I have provided a list of land <br>surveyors listed in the local Yellow Pages. Third, you may know which <br>surveyor conducted your survey. If so, give them a call and see if they <br>stil  have your Certificate on file. <br> <br>
In any case, you wil need to provide the insurance carrier handling <br>
your ICC claim some type of official document that states the level of <br>your property relative to BFE before they can proceed with your claim.  <br>
<hr>
<A name=10></a><hr>
<A name=11></a><b>3.  MY HOME OR PROPERTY IS “SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED” </b><br>
<b>ACCORDING TO THE CITY, AND IT IS BELOW BFE ACCORDING TO <br>MY FLOOD ELEVATION CERTIFICATE.  WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW? </b><br>
 <br>
a.  If you have flood insurance issued under the Federal NFIP (most <br>
cases), contact your flood insurance carrier and/or adjuster.  Ask <br>them who is handling ICC Claims.  Contact that person and tell <br>them you wish to file an ICC claim and to send you an ICC claim <br>packet outlining the documents they wil  need to process the claim.  <br>The documentary requirements wil  be the same for all NFIP <br>registered insurance carriers.  See the attached list of documents <br>that you should expect to submit to the insurance carrier. <br>
 <br>
<b>NOTE</b>: Don’t wait until you have every item on the list before <br>submitting your application to the insurance carrier.  Give them <br>what you have now, and send them what you get later as soon as <br>you can.  We all know how slowly things get done right now.   <br>
 <br>
<b>If you do not have flood insurance issued under the NFIP, you <br>are not eligible to apply for funds under the ICC program</b>.<br>
b.  Look in the Yellow Pages or similar publication for a list of local <br>
foundation repair specialists.  For your convenience I included a <br>sample in this packet.   Call and ask for representatives from at <br>least two companies to visit your home or property to give you an <br>estimate on raising the house by the foot/inches amount shown by <br>your Flood Elevation Certificate.  If you find that these companies <br>tell you January or February before they can even come out to <br>estimate the job and you need something sooner, consider finding <br>and calling similar companies in surrounding states; some of these <br>out-of-state companies may be prepared to come into Louisiana to <br>take on work.  In my case, I used a contractor operating out of <br>Texas.  If you find a contractor out-of-state, be sure to remind them <br>they will need to have a resident contractor’s license, or work with a <br>Louisiana licensed contractor to obtain the permit.  <br>
 <br>
<b>NOTE</b>: you wil  need to provide the insurance carrier with an <br>contractor’s quote/estimate as part of the ICC claim processing <br>requirements. <br>
<hr>
<A name=12></a><b>4.  I HAVE RECEIVED THE ICC CLAIM PACKET AND I HAVE </b><br>
<b>SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH A FOUNDATION REPAIR <br>CONTRACTOR, OR HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE <br>QUOTE FROM A CONTRACTOR. </b><br>
 <br>
When you speak with the contractor, tell them that any work you have <br>done must be done in accordance with the standards set by City’s Flood <br>Management Ordinance (“code”).  Make that demand explicit in any <br>contract that you eventually sign.  Do not assume that they are familiar <br>with the code regarding flood elevation work.  If necessary, refer the <br>contractor to the copy of the code that you will submit with your ICC claim.  <br> <br>
Of particular concern to city inspectors is that any foundation that is <br>
added to the existing be tied in (“anchored”) to both the old foundation and <br>the new.  Make sure that your contractor understands this, and the <br>methods likely acceptable to the City. <br> <br>Note: If you can, arrange for a structural engineer or consulting engineer <br>with foundation expertise to do a pre-inspection with written <br>recommendations for the contractor.   <br>
 <br>
Note: If you have a pier and beam house that currently has no <b>termite <br>shields</b> between the piers and the beams.  Ask the contractor about <br>getting them installed when your house is raised off the original foundation <br>piers.   <br>
 <br>If you have not already visited or contacted the City Safety and <br>
Permits office about <b>obtaining a building permit</b>, now is the time to do <br>that. The City wil  ask you for advance payment on applying for the permit.  <br>Make sure that you get reimbursed for this by the contractor, or from ICC <br>funds.  Once you find a contractor, you can let them complete the <br>permitting process with the City. Eventually the City wil  need some form <br>of detailed documentation from the contractor showing the existing <br>foundation and the planned work. The City is taking permit applications <br>with minimal information, and opening a file for each application.  As you <br>or the contractor obtain any documents that the City needs to complete <br>the application, you can submit them to be added to your permit <br>application file. <br>
 <br>The City has made available various documents outlining what is <br>
required to issue a building permit to raise a house.  I have included those <br>in this packet, but they are also available at the City website, <br><A href="http://wwwcityofno.com/">http://www.cityofno.com </a>on the Safety and Permits page, or they are  <br>available in hard copy from the Safety and Permits office. <br>
<hr>
<A name=13></a>The Safety and Permits staff are doing a great job to make the <br>
permitting process as quick and easy to understand as possible.  What <br>documents they ask for is going to differ according to your case, but it may <br>be that some documentary requirements for  ‘normal’ times might not be <br>required while the situation is ‘abnormal.’  <br>
 <br>Expect about 5-7 days to go by from the time your permit <br>
application is complete until the permit is issued.  The City will post the <br>permit on your property, but you can get a copy from the Safety and <br>permits office that you can use to submit as part of your ICC claim.  See <br>the example included in this packet. <br>
 <br><b>NOTE</b>: Try to ensure that the permit states how high your property <br>
wil  be elevated.  This wil  require that you determine how high you must <br>go to reach BFE from the Top of Bottom Floor elevation stated on your <br>pre-existing Flood Elevation Certificate, or from a new Top of Bottom Floor <br>elevation figure taken from a survey you have just had done. <br>

<A name=17></a>5.  <b>GATHER TOGETHER THE ITEMS REQUIRED TO PROCESS YOUR </b><br>
<b>ICC CLAIM (LISTED IN YOUR CLAIM PACKET) AND SEND THE ICC <br>CLAIM REPRESENTATIVE WHAT YOU HAVE. </b> <br>
a.  Copy of the “Substantial Damage” letter issued to you by the City <br>
(or a printout of the online report).   <br>
 <br>b.  Evidence of the chosen mitigation measure – this just means they <br>
want you to state in writing that you intend to raise your house. <br>
 <br>
c.  An estimate/quote from a contractor to perform the house raising.  <br>
Some insurance carriers may demand 2 quotes.  It’s a good idea to <br>get at least two quotes for comparison, but if that’s just not possible <br>in a reasonable time frame, just know that I was not required to <br>submit more than one quote.  Nor was I required to provide an <br>itemized breakdown of the quote.  Just some indication of the work <br>to be done, including the projected height to be raised seems to be <br>enough. <br>
 <br>
d.  Building Permit.  See above.   <br>
 <br>
e.  Secure a copy of the “substantial damage” provision in the <br>
community’s Floodplain Management Ordinance.  This means that <br>they want you to submit a copy of the City’s Flood Plain <br>Management code.  This is dumb.  It’s publicly available at <br><A href="http://www.municode.com/">http://www.municode.com </a>by searching for Orleans Parish -- Article <br>II. Flood Damage Prevention.  It is Section 78 of the City Code.  If <br>they insist you send them a hardcopy, like my insurance carrier did, <br>just print out a copy from the internet if you have access, or copy <br>the copy of the code I have included in this packet. <br>
 <br>
f.  Copy of your property Real Estate Appraisal or Tax Assessment.  <br>
The City has not yet issued a Tax Bil  for the coming year, so you <br>can either submit a copy of last year’s bil  if you have one, or call <br>your District’s Assessors office ask them to print a copy of your file <br>from the mainframe. <br>
 <br>
g.  Photographs of the property before the work has begun.  You <br>
should already have photos that you used when applying for the <br>“substantial Damage” letter/report.  Use copies of those, or take <br>new ones – of the front, rear and sides of the house.  Note:  they <br>wil  also ask you for photographs of the work in progress and the <br>work completed.  The insurance carrier in my case was not too <br>
<hr>
<A name=18></a>particular about how many and of what aspect of the house, so long <br>as there was some visual evidence that the work was done. <br>
 <br>
h.  A copy of the current Flood Elevation Certificate, <i>or other </i><br>
<i>documentation</i> confirming the current base flood elevation.  <br>Remember we talked about this already.  Basically, they want to <br>see a document showing the difference between the level of your <br>house, and where it should be according to the FEMA map for your <br>flood zone. <br>
 <br>
i.  Signed and notarized copy of the Proof of Loss form that the ICC <br>
claim rep sends.  This form wil  be sent to you when the rep has <br>your property’s value, and your contractor’s estimate.  See the copy <br>I included in this packet. <br>
 <br>
As I mentioned earlier, send what you have, when you have it.  Get the <br>ball rolling as soon as possible.  Everything is going to take twice as <br>long as you think or they say.  Expect mistakes and miscommunication <br>to occur – then you won’t be so mad at how long everything takes. <br> <br><b>NOTE</b>: If you can, make the ICC claim rep confirm exactly what you <br>have submitted, and ask again what, if anything else they need. I was <br>not told initially that I would have to sign and notarize a Proof of Loss.  <br>Getting this done and returned to the ICC claim rep is necessary <br>before they wil  issue any ICC money.  It adds at least a day or two to <br>the delay before you actually get money.  <br> <br><b>NOTE</b>: The best approach to take with the carrier (and all companies <br>or agencies you deal with, in fact) is <b>POLITE BUT PERSISTENT</b>. Let <br>them know you are ‘on the case’ and ready to get the job done.   <br> <br>
DON’T WAIT FOR STUFF TO HAPPEN. MAKE IT HAPPEN.<br>
<hr>
<A name=19></a>6.  <b>CHOOSE A CONTRACTOR, AND NEGOTIATE A START DATE.</b> <br>
The big issue here is timing.  My contractor was ready to start in just a <br>couple of weeks after he gave his estimate. That is rare indeed.  I would <br>not expect that to happen again in your case. <br> <br>If you’re keen to get started as soon as possible and you don’t want to <br>lose the contractor to another job, remember to consider the BIG factor –<br>money.  You don’t want to find yourself in a situation, like me, where I had <br>to pay the contractor a downpayment on commencement before any ICC <br>funds had arrived from the insurance carrier.  If you can carry a $10000 or <br>$15000 payment from your own funds (maybe ‘borrow’ some from your <br>flood insurance settlement proceeds) then go ahead.  But if you have time <br>but no spare money to tie up for a few weeks, it may be better to wait until <br>the ICC check is safely deposited in your bank before you set a start date <br>with the contractor. <br> <br><b>NOTE</b>: ICC fund are paid in two increments:  50% in advance.  50% after <br>completion of the work AND after submission of the following documents <br>to the insurance carrier/ICC claim rep: <br> <br>
1.  A document issued by the City confirming that the work has <br>
passed inspections and is in compliance with code. <br>
2.  A copy of the new Flood Elevation Certificate issued after a <br>
surveyor has taken new readings on your property after the <br>house has been raised. <br>
3.  More photographs – this time of the work completed. <br>
 <br>
<b>NOTE</b>: Depending on how your carrier administers ICC claims, the claim <br>may be handled by the adjuster before being forwarded to the insurance <br>carrier for approval and check issuing.  This may add a few days <br>processing time while documents are in transit.  Ask the ICC claims <br>person to send/receive as much of documentation as possible by email or <br>fax.  You should be able to fax them a copy of the signed/notarized Proof <br>of Loss so they can begin processing while the original is sent to them via <br>US Mail. <br>
 <br>
<b>NOTE</b>: You have no obligation to raise your house immediately. You <br>have up to 2 years from the date of loss (on or about August 29, 2005 for <br>Katrina flood victims) to have the work completed.  <br> <br>The way I understand this, the City should also allow you the same <br>amount of time to come into compliance with code, or take some other <br>action that might permit you not to come into compliance, either for an <br>extended period or indefinitely. <br>

<A name=23></a><b>7.  WHEN THE HOUSE RAISING WORK IS COMPLETE <br></b> <br>Depending on the method used, raising a small to moderate size pier and <br>beam house can take 5-7 days of preparation and actual lifting and a couple <br>of days total for set-up, breakdown of equipment and final shimming/levelling.  <br>My contractor used boat jacks and cement blocks, gradually raising one side <br>or corner before moving to the opposite side.  When the house is raised to the <br>level required by your BFE and floor elevation readings, the contractor wil  <br>level and shim the house.  Our timber deck was lifted along with the house.  <br>Columns don’t necessarily create special problems <br> <br>When the work is complete, contact the Safety and Permits office again to <br>arrange an inspection of the finished work.  An inspector wil  come out and <br>examine the work for its compliance with the Code. When the work passes, <br>the City can usually have a written report within a few days.  If it does not <br>pass, the City will issue a correction notice to outline what yet needs to be <br>done.  This is where it is important, as you remember, to have <b>specified in <br>writing with the contractor that the work should be done to current <br>Flood Plain Management code</b>. No arguments. If the contractor is <br>responsible and professional, they will do their homework and ensure they <br>know what to expect.  Do not be left arguing about additional work and extra <br>cost at the end of this ordeal – especially if the original contract price is very <br>close to the $30000 maximum payable from ICC funds.  <br> <br>At the same time you arrange the City inspection, make arrangements with a <br>land surveyor to conduct a new Flood Elevation survey.  The cost wil  be <br>anywhere from $200-$300, and the written report is usually available within 2 <br>business days. <br> <br>Don’t forget to take pictures of the house raised (front, back, both sides). <br> <br>In order to receive the final 50% of the ICC funds, the insurance carrier wil  <br>ask for these three items: post-completion Flood Elevation Certificate, written <br>notice of compliance from the City, pictures. <br>

<A name=26></a>New Orleans Flood Plain Management Ordinance (Excerpts) <br> <br>
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY  <br> <br>Sec. 78-36. Statutory authorization.  <br>The state legislature has in R.S. 33:101 through R.S. 33:130.1 and R.S. 33:4721 <br>through R.S. 33:4732 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to <br>adopt regulations for the physical development of parishes and municipalities <br>and for the exercise of police power.  <br>(Code 1956, § 32-1)  <br> <br>Sec. 78-37. Finding of fact.  <br>(a)     The flood hazard areas of the parish are subject to periodic inundation <br>which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of <br>commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for <br>flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety <br>and general welfare.  <br>(b)     These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in <br>floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the <br>occupancy of flood hazard areas by use vulnerable to floods and hazards to <br>other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise <br>protected from flood damage.  <br>(Code 1956, § 32-2)  <br> <br>Sec. 78-38. Statement of purpose.  <br>(a)     The principal purpose of the regulations in this article is to prescribe <br>minimum requirements for land use and control measures for floodprone areas in <br>the city, as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). <br>These regulations are based upon relevant technical storm data specific to the <br>parish, as developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National <br>Academy of Sciences. These measures must be applied uniformly throughout <br>the community to all privately and publicly owned land with in floodprone areas, <br>based upon standards set forth in these regulations, as prescribed by the Federal <br>Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  <br>(b)     Official flood maps entitled Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for Orleans <br>Parish, Louisiana (Community Panel Nos. 225203 0001--0185), dated March 1, <br>1984, as amended, inclusive of FEMA Letters of Map Amendment dated May 9, <br>1984 and August 29, 1984, relative to Tall Timbers Extensions, Ponding Area 33, <br>and inclusive of FEMA conditional Letter of Map Revision dated July 11, 1986, <br>relative to the South Shore Harbor Project, are adopted by the city and on file <br>with the clerk of council.  <br>(Code 1956, § 32-3)  <br> <br>

<A name=27></a>Sec. 78-39. Methods of reducing flood losses.  <br>(a)     In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods:  <br>(1)     Restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property <br>in times of flood, or cause excessive increase in flood heights or velocities;  <br>(2)     Requires that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve <br>such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;  <br>(3)     Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural <br>protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;  <br>(4)     Controls fil ing, grading, dredging and other development which may <br>increase flood damage; and  <br>(5)     Prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which wil  <br>unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other <br>lands.  <br>(b)     The city's participation in the FEMA sponsored Community Rating System <br>(CRS) Program will provide a new incentive for activities that reduce flood losses <br>and support the sale of flood insurance. This program wil  result in flood premium <br>reductions for city residents. The city planning commission has been designated <br>as the city's lead agency or CRS coordinator to the program. Part of the <br>program's goal is to actively involve city and associated agencies in the <br>development, advertising, and enforcement of any activity that would reduce <br>property damage and residential liability in the event of flooding. Participation in <br>the CRS Program includes annual review and revision of the floodplain <br>management plan for the city which wil  include a public hearing process, <br>citywide mail-outs and other forms of public advertisement. The management <br>plan wil  be made available to the public and interested parties through the city <br>public library system, city planning commission, department of safety and <br>permits, and the office of the clerk of council.  <br>(Code 1956, § 32-4)  <br> <br>Sec. 78-40. Definitions.  <br>The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the <br>meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly <br>indicates a different meaning:  <br>Appeal means a request for a review of the director's interpretation of any <br>provision of this article or a request for a variance.  <br>Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a <br>community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or <br>greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where <br>a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is <br>unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is <br>characterized by ponding or sheet flow.  <br>Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community <br>subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The <br>area may be designated as zone A on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). After <br>detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the <br>
<hr>
<A name=28></a>FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, <br>VE or V.  <br>Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or <br>exceeded in any given year.  <br>Benchmark elevations means the January 1986 adjustment of the 1985 Vertical <br>Control Survey of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, published by National Geodetic <br>Survey and/or any subsequent adjustments published by National Geodetic <br>Survey and recognized by FEMA.  <br> <br>Breakaway walls means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the <br>building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under <br>specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of <br>the building or supporting foundation system.  <br>Coastal high-hazard area means the area subject to high-velocity waters, <br>including but not limited to hurricane wave wash or tsunamis. The area is <br>designated on a FIRM as zone V1-30, VE or V.  <br>Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection <br>system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would <br>be compromised.  <br>Development means any work involving mining, dredging, fil ing, grading, paving, <br>excavation or dril ing operations but excluding those activities whose review is <br>already controlled by subdivision regulations, which encompass the elevation <br>determination for all street paving, curb grades and subsurface drainage as <br>determined by the department of streets based on flood slope elevations of major <br>drainage canals furnished by the sewerage and water board. First floor or lowest <br>elevation of any structural member wil  be ass igned by the department of safety <br>and permits. Also expected are minor activities normally conducted in the course <br>of general maintenance such as planting or deposit of fil  or improved property as <br>well as those activities that are the responsibilities of public agencies in carrying <br>out their duties for which they are capable of determining elevations and are <br>knowledgeable of floodprone areas as determined by the Federal Emergency <br>Management Agency.  <br>Director means the director of the department of safety and permits of the city.  <br>Elevated building means a nonbasement building:  <br>(1)     Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, <br>and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones <br>V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of <br>the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns <br>(posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water; and  <br>(2)     Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the <br>building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood.  <br>In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, the term <br>&quot;elevated building&quot; also includes a building elevated by means of fil  or solid <br>foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded <br>movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, the term <br>&quot;elevated building&quot; also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of <br>
<hr>
<A name=29></a>elevated building, even though the lower area is enclosed by means of <br>breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) <br>of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations (NFIP Regulations).  <br>Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for <br>which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM <br>or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. Existing <br>construction may also be referred to as &quot;existing structures.&quot;  <br>Federal insurance administrator means the individual to whom the director of the <br>Federal Emergency Management Agency has delegated the administration of the <br>program (44 CFR 9.45 FR 59520 September 9, 1980).  <br>Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete <br>inundation of normally dry land areas from:  <br>(1)     The overflow of inland or tidal waters.  <br>(2)     The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any <br>source.  <br>Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on <br>which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the <br>areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the <br>community.  <br>Flooding insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency <br>Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation <br>of the base flood, and the flood boundary-floodway map.  <br>Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being <br>inundated by water from any source (see definition of &quot;flooding&quot;).  <br>Floodplain management program means the operation of all overall programs of <br>corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not <br>limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and land use and <br>control measures.  <br>Floodproofed means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, <br>changes or adjustments to properties and structures which reduce or eliminate <br>flood damage to lands, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and contents of <br>buildings.  <br>Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds <br>have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been <br>constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the <br>areas within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the <br>depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal <br>barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying <br>works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering s tandards.  <br>Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended <br>purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term <br>includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading <br>and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, <br>but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.  <br>
<hr>
<A name=30></a>Habitable floor means any floor usable for the following purposes: working, <br>sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used for <br>storage purposes only is not a habitable floor.  <br>Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground <br>surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.  <br>Land use and control measures means zoning ordinances, subdivision <br>regulations, building codes, health regulations, and other applications and <br>extensions of the normal police power, to provide standards and effective <br>enforcement provisions for prudent use and occupancy of floodprone and <br>mudslide areas.  <br>Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed <br>and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, <br>control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary <br>flooding.  <br>Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or <br>levees, and associated structures such as closure and drainage devices, which <br>are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.  <br>Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including <br>basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking <br>of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is <br>not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built <br>so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design <br>requirement of section 60.3 of the NFIP Regulations.  <br>Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, <br>which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a <br>permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain <br>management purposes the term &quot;manufactured home&quot; also includes park trailers, <br>travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 <br>consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term &quot;manufactured home&quot; does <br>not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar v ehicles.  <br>Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) <br>of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.  <br>Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, <br>the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of January 1986 Adjustment of the <br>1985 Vertical Control Survey of Orleans Parish, Louisiana or other datum to <br>which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map <br>are referenced.  <br>100-year flood (storm) means the highest level of a flooding that, on the average, <br>is likely to occur once every 100 years (i.e., that has a one percent chance of <br>occurring each year).  <br>New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for <br>which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the <br>ordinance from which this article was derived.  <br>Program deficiency means a defect in a community's floodplain management <br>regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of <br>
<hr>
<A name=31></a>those floodplains management regulations or of the standards in section 60.3, <br>60.4, 60.5, or 60.6 of the NFIP Regulations.  <br>Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into <br>compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations or, if this is not <br>possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impact may be <br>reduced include protecting the structure or other affected developments from <br>flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or <br>otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial <br>exposure with regard to the structure or other development.  <br>Residential structure means a building or portion thereof, designed or used <br>exclusively for residential occupancy but not including trailers, hotels, motels or <br>motor lodges.  <br>Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial <br>improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), <br>includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was <br>issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, <br>placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The <br>actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a <br>structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of <br>piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; <br>or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent <br>construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and <br>fil ing; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it <br>include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of <br>temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory <br>buildings, such as garages or sheds not oc cupied as dwelling units or not part of <br>the main structure.  <br>Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage <br>tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.  <br>Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a <br>structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of <br>the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure <br>has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the <br>purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when <br>the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building <br>commences, whether or not that alteration aff ects the external dimensions of the <br>structure. The term does not, however, include either:  <br>(1)     Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or <br>local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to <br>assure safe living conditions; or  <br>(2)     Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic <br>Places or a state inventory of historic places.  <br>V zone: See Coastal high-hazard area.  <br>Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when <br>specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, <br>
<hr>
<A name=32></a>therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited <br>by this article. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the NFIP Regulations.)  <br>Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully <br>compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure <br>or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or <br>other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), <br>(e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the NFIP Regulations is presumed to be in violation until <br>such time as that documentation is provided.  <br>Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic <br>Vertical Datum (NGVD) of January 1986 adjustment of the 1985 Vertical Control <br>Survey of Orleans Parish, Louisiana (or other datum, where specified), of floods <br>of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine <br>areas.  <br>(Code 1956, § 32-5)  <br>Cross references: Definitions generally, § 1-2.  <br> <br>Sec. 78-41.

The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shal  not be <br>subject to collapse, displacement or other structural damage due to the effects of wind <br>and water loads acting simultaneously on al  building components (structural and <br>nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination <br>
