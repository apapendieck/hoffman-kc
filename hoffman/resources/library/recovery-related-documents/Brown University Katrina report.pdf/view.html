<b>The Impact of Katrina: Race and Class in Storm-Damaged Neighborhoods </b><br>
 <br>Early media reports about the wind damage and flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina focused <br>on New Orleans, and especially on the people who had been unable to escape the city before it <br>flooded.  Images of poor and predominantly black people crowded into the Superdome and <br>Convention Center supported the impression that Katrina had disproportionately affected poor, <br>black neighborhoods.  The purpose of this report is to evaluate more precisely what <br>neighborhoods were heavily damaged, including not only New Orleans but also the coastal <br>communities in Mississippi that bore the brunt of hurricane-force winds.   <br> <br>In brief an analysis of FEMA storm damage data shows that the storm’s impact was <br>disproportionately borne by the region’s African American community, by people who rented <br>their homes, and by the poor and unemployed. <br> <br>1.  More than a third of the region’s 1.7 million residents lived in areas that suffered flooding or <br>moderate to catastrophic storm damage, according to FEMA.  The majority of people living in <br>damaged areas were in the City of New Orleans (over 350,000), with additional concentrations in <br>suburban Jefferson Parish (175,000) and St. Bernard Parish (53,000) and along the Mississippi <br>Coast (54,000). <br> <br>2.  In the region as a whole, the disparities in storm damage are shown in the following <br>comparisons (arranged in order of the degree of disparity): <br>
•  By race.  Damaged areas were 45.8% black, compared to 26.4% in undamaged areas. <br>•  By housing tenure.  45.7% of homes in damaged areas were occupied by renters, <br>
compared to 30.9% in undamaged communities. <br>
•  By poverty and employment status.  20.9% of households had incomes below the poverty <br>
line in damaged areas, compared to 15.3% in undamaged areas.  7.6% of persons in the <br>labor force were unemployed in damaged areas (before the storm), compared to 6.0% in <br>undamaged areas.   <br>
 <br>3.  These comparisons are heavily influenced by the experience of the City of New Orleans.  <br>Outside the city, there were actually smaller shares of African American, poor, and unemployed <br>residents in the damaged areas.   <br> <br>4.  Closer inspection of neighborhoods within New Orleans shows that some affluent white <br>neighborhoods were hard hit, while some poor minority neighborhoods were spared.  Yet if the <br>post-Katrina city were limited to the population previously living in areas that were undamaged <br>by the storm – that is, if nobody were able to return to damaged neighborhoods – New Orleans is <br>at risk of losing more than 80% of its black population.  This means that policy choices affecting <br>who can return, to which neighborhoods, and with what forms of public and private assistance, <br>will greatly affect the future character of the city. <br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a><b>Methods of analysis <br></b> <br>Information on affected areas is drawn primarily from FEMA, which has provided detailed maps <br>of zones of flooding and wind damage.  Areas of flooding do not further distinguish between <br>areas where water was deeper or remained for a longer time period.  FEMA uses a standard <br>system for assessing other storm damage.  The “limited damage” category is applied to areas <br>with “generally superficial damage to solid structures (e.g. loss of tiles or roof shingles); some <br>mobile homes and light structures are damaged or displaced.”  These areas are not treated as <br>“damaged” in this report.  The next more severe category is “moderate damage,” where “solid <br>structures sustain exterior damage (e.g. missing roofs or roof segments); some mobile homes and <br>light structures are destroyed, many are damaged or displaced.”  Areas with moderate damage or <br>greater are treated here as “damaged.”  <br> <br>Within parts of the City of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish, the FEMA map of “full extent” <br>of flood damage does not correspond well with reports on the ground.  This primarily affects <br>parts of the French Quarter, Marigny, and Bywater in New Orleans (where flooding was less <br>extensive than reported by FEMA) and St. Bernard Parish (where some additional areas appear <br>to have been flooded).  We have corrected the map of flooded areas in these zones based on <br>remote sensing imagery from September 2, 2005, made available by the Dartmouth Flood <br>Observatory (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~floods).   <br> <br> <br>

 <br>The photograph above illustrates the effects of heavy flooding in the Lower Ninth Ward of New <br>Orleans.  In other parts of the city there was little structural damage, but many houses needed to <br>be entirely gutted as a result of days or weeks of being submerged in water.     <br> <br> <br>

<A name=3></a>The second photograph illustrates wind damage of the type sustained along much of the <br>Mississippi Coast as well as in New Orleans.  This example would likely be classified as <br>moderate, and falls within the definition of damage used in this report. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

 <br>Information about residents of these zones is from the Census 2000, using tract-level population <br>data.  Changes that occurred between 2000 and 2005 are not reflected here.  Geographic <br>Information System techniques have been used to determine the proportion of land area <br>identified as “flooded” or “moderately to catastrophically damaged” in each census tract in the <br>region.  Where the damaged area only covers a portion of the tract, it is not possible to know <br>with precision how many residents of the tract lived in that portion.  The analysis is based on the <br>assumption that people are spread equally across the tract, and that social characteristics of <br>residents of the damaged portion are the same as social characteristics of the tract as a whole.  <br>An alternative approach would be to use census data at the level of block groups, which is a finer <br>unit of geography.  This would make it possible to line up the neighborhood data more closely <br>with the boundaries of the damaged zones, though the match would still not be exact. However <br>block group data from the census is less reliable than data for census tracts, due to techniques <br>employed by the census bureau to maintain confidentiality of information and to correct for <br>missing data.   <br> <br>A similar analysis has been completed by the Congressional Research Service (available at <br>http://www.gnocdc.org/reports/crsrept.pdf).  This report reaches similar conclusions regarding <br>the region as a whole, but provides more detailed information about variations among <br>neighborhoods in the City of New Orleans, where the majority of affected persons lived. <br> <br>
 <br>

<hr>
<A name=4></a>The report focuses on the New Orleans and Biloxi-Gulfport metropolitan areas of Louisiana and <br>Mississippi.  About 4500 people are estimated to live in areas in the Mobile, AL metropolitan <br>region (Mobile and Baldwin Counties) that meet the FEMA damage criterion used here.  A wider <br>geographic area has been designated by FEMA as qualifying for federal disaster relief, including <br>assistance to individuals and to public agencies.  A much larger number of people were affected <br>by Katrina, either because they were forced to evacuate from their homes for extended periods, <br>or they suffered damage to their homes, or they lost power or other basic public services <br>(services that in large areas were still in the process of being restored as of January 2005).  There <br>is no reliable source of information on the number or social composition of people who were <br>affected in these ways.  Attention here, therefore, is limited to identifying whose neighborhoods <br>suffered the greatest impact of the storm, in areas that will likely require the most concentrated <br>attention in the recovery process. <br> <br>
 <br>
 <br>To supplement this report, Brown University’s American Communities Project has developed a <br>web-based map system that includes all of the information analyzed here.  The site is <br>http://www.s4.brown.edu/Katrina/index.html.  It identifies the broad zones of the three-state <br>region where FEMA was authorized to provide assistance.  It also shows the more specific areas <br>classified as flooded or moderately to catastrophically storm-damaged by FEMA.  At a detailed <br>zoom level, the user can display aerial photographs from early September 2001 that have been <br>made available by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at <br>http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/katrina.  The web system also displays a wide variety of population <br>characteristics from Census 2000 for census tracts.  Within the City of New Orleans, it is also <br>possible to see how census tracts are grouped into neighborhoods by the city for planning <br>
 <br>

<hr>
<A name=5></a>purposes.  This system also offers the capability to download data for a specific census tract or <br>group of tracts, and to copy the image of any map for use in other applications. <br> <br>For reference, Figure 1 above provides a map of the affected region.  It shows the boundaries of <br>the New Orleans metropolitan area in Louisiana, including the Parishes of Orleans (the city <br>proper), Jefferson, Plaquemine, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist, and St. <br>Tammany, and the Biloxi-Gulfport metropolitan area in Mississippi, including the Counties of <br>Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson.   <br> <br>

<A name=6></a><b>The population in areas of extensive damage <br></b> <br>Within New Orleans and Biloxi-Gulfport metropolitan areas, flooding was concentrated in and <br>around New Orleans, and wind damage was focused on a narrow band along the Mississippi <br>Coast.  Table 1 provides estimates of the population living in these areas, categorized by <br>metropolitan area and county or parish.   <br> <br>Nearly 650,000 persons, more than a third of the region’s population, lived in heavily damaged <br>areas.  More than half of these, 354,000, lived in Orleans Parish.  Another 175,000 lived in <br>adjacent Jefferson Parish, with 53,000 in St. Bernard Parish, and about 54,000 in the 3-county <br>area along the Mississippi Coast. <br> <br>St. Bernard and Orleans Parishes had the highest shares of their populations in damaged zones, <br>both above 70%.  More than 45% of residents of Hancock County, MS, lived in such areas, as <br>did more than 38% of residents of Jefferson Parish. <br> <br> <br>

<A name=7></a><b>Social composition of the population in damaged areas <br></b> <br>Who are the people who lived in the most damaged areas?  One way to answer this question is to <br>compare the social composition of damaged areas with that of the remaining less damaged parts <br>of the region.  Table 2 does this for the following areas: the City of New Orleans itself, the larger <br>New Orleans metropolitan region including the city, and the Biloxi-Gulfport metropolitan region <br>in Mississippi.  In the final rows are presented the data for all of these areas combined. <br> <br>

 <br>The data for the total region show that in several respects the neighborhoods of social groups <br>with least resources were the ones most affected by Katrina.  The population of damaged areas <br>was nearly half black (45.8% compared to 26.4% black in the rest of the region), living in rental <br>housing (45.7% compared to 30.9%), and disproportionately below the poverty line (20.9% <br>compared to 15.3%) and unemployed (7.6% compared to 6.0%). <br> <br>Certainly the storm struck the neighborhoods of many people of all backgrounds.  If we examine <br>the absolute numbers behind these percentages, we note that there were almost as many non-<br>Hispanic whites as blacks in damaged areas (294,000 compared to 295,000), and the number of <br>persons in these neighborhoods above the poverty line was much larger than the number of poor <br>persons.  This means that the suffering from the storm partly cut across racial and class lines.  <br>But the odds of living in a damaged area were clearly much greater for blacks, renters, and poor <br>people.  In these respects the most vulnerable residents turned out also to be at greatest risk.  As <br>will be discussed in the conclusion, poor and black people also have fewer resources for <br>returning and rebuilding. <br> <br>Some attention in the aftermath of Katrina was drawn to elderly persons who were stranded in <br>nursing homes or in their own residences.  Particular concern has been expressed for elderly <br>persons who are disabled and therefore have the least mobility.  Table 2 includes information on <br>the percentage of persons who are over 65 and report at least one disabling condition as defined <br>in Census 2000.  Here, too, there is some disparity, but it is modest: 5.8% of persons in damaged <br>areas meet these criteria, only slightly more than the 4.8% in other neighborhoods. <br> <br>Behind the overall pattern are some large differences within the region.  The disparities by race <br>and poverty/unemployment can be traced more specifically to the City of New Orleans.  In the <br>city, for example, 75% of residents of damaged areas were black, compared to undamaged areas <br>
 <br>
7 <br>
<hr>
<A name=8></a>where a majority of residents were white.  But in the suburbs, including both Jefferson Parish <br>and St. Bernard Parish that were hard hit by Katrina, as well as on the Mississippi Coast, the <br>affected neighborhoods were more likely to be predominantly white, and neighborhoods with <br>larger shares of black residents were actually less likely to be heavily damaged.  In these parts of <br>the region, wealthy neighborhoods were as likely, in some cases even more likely, to be damaged <br>as were poor neighborhoods.  In Jefferson and St. Bernard Parishes, for example, the <br>neighborhoods with higher educational and professional levels tended to be the hardest hit (this <br>is not shown in the table).   <br> <br>Disparities were reduced along the Mississippi Coast because many of the most desirable pre-<br>Katrina locations were located near the shoreline and therefore exposed to both high winds and <br>storm surge.   <br> <br>With respect to housing tenure, there is little difference within the City of New Orleans between <br>damaged and undamaged areas.  In both sectors within the city the majority of homes were <br>renter-occupied.  The overall disadvantage of renters has two sources.  First, outside of the city <br>the neighborhoods of renters were more damaged.  Second, a larger part of the city population <br>(with its large proportion of renters) was affected. <br> <br>

<A name=9></a><b>Differential impacts within the City of New Orleans <br></b> <br>Because flooding within the City of New Orleans accounts for such a large share of the impacts <br>of Katrina, the final portion of this report is devoted to analyzing variations across <br>neighborhoods of the city.  Figure 2 is a map showing census tracts in New Orleans as well as <br>suburban areas to the west and south.  The red vertical line extending into Lake Pontchartrain is <br>the boundary between the city and neighboring Jefferson Parish.  Damaged areas are identified <br>with a yellow boundary and yellow hatch lines.  The interested reader can peruse similar maps <br>for any part of the three-state region, showing variations by race and many other population <br>characteristics, at http://www.s4.brown.edu/Katrina/index.html. <br> <br>This map shows that the undamaged areas of the city were mainly in two areas.  One is just north <br>of the Mississippi River in a zone extending westward from downtown.  The other is across the <br>river on the West Bank, in a district known as Algiers.  The map shows that some predominantly <br>white neighborhoods in the northwest part of the city were entirely damaged.  However almost <br>all of the neighborhoods that were in the range of 75-100% black at the time of Census 2000  <br>were damaged.   <br>

<A name=10></a>For planning purposes, New Orleans is divided into 13 planning districts and 72 distinct <br>neighborhoods within these districts.  The neighborhood names and boundaries are shown in <br>Figure 3 (for reference, see the website of the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center, <br>www.gnocdc.org.)   <br> <br>
  <br> <br>Table 3 cumulates data from census tracts to these larger units, reporting the total population of <br>neighborhoods and planning districts as well as the number and percentage of residents in <br>damaged areas.  Planning districts are listed in order from those with the highest portion of <br>residents in damaged areas to those with the least damage.  Neighborhoods within planning <br>districts are listed likewise. <br> <br>The Algiers Planning District, located across the river in what is called the West Bank, suffered <br>little damage, and it alone accounts for about 50,000 of the 130,000 New Orleans residents in <br>undamaged zones.  Other areas with less than the average level of damage include lightly <br>populated New Aurora and Village de l’Est, the French Quarter/CBD, the Central City-Garden <br>District, and the Uptown-Carrollton Planning Districts.  There is variation within these areas, <br>however.  In the Central City-Garden District, for example, neighborhoods like the Garden <br>District itself, Irish Channel, and Touro had no damage, while 80% or more of residents of <br>Central City/Magnolia and Milan lived in damaged areas.  <br> <br>

<A name=13></a> <br>At the other end of the spectrum, Mid-City, New Orleans East, Gentilly, the Lower Ninth Ward, <br>Bywater, and Lakeview all had 90% or more of their residents in damaged areas.   <br> <br>Table 3 also provides information about the social composition of these areas.  The Table reveals <br>great variation within New Orleans.  Some largely white neighborhoods of affluent homeowners <br>were completely flooded, while some relatively poor black neighborhoods were spared.  <br>However there is a general tendency as shown in Table 2 for blacks and poor residents to have <br>greater odds of being in harm’s way. <br> <br>Discussions of the racially differential impact of Katrina have often emphasized the Lower Ninth <br>Ward (where many homes were entirely demolished by the breach in the levee of the Industrial <br>Canal) and New Orleans East.  Most neighborhoods in these planning districts were more than <br>85% black, and most residences were damaged.  A majority of residents of both of these <br>planning districts were homeowners, though there were clear class distinctions between the two <br>areas.  More than a third of Lower Ninth Ward residents were below the poverty line, and nearly <br>14% were unemployed.  New Orleans East had a considerably larger middle class component, <br>though it was not among the city’s most affluent sections. <br> <br>Many of the most segregated neighborhoods with the highest poverty rates are those identified as <br>“projects,” a reference to the prominence of public housing within their borders.  The project <br>neighborhoods typically had poverty rates in the range of 60-80% of the population, <br>unemployment is above 20%, they were all predominantly black (with African Americans <br>accounting for 90% or more of their residents), and 80% or more of residents were renters.  <br>There are six such neighborhoods in New Orleans (though there are concentrations of public <br>housing or Section 8 housing in other parts of the city).  In five of them with a combined 2000 <br>population of over 15,000 persons (Calliope, Iberville, St. Bernard Area, Desire, and Florida) the <br>entire territory meets this report’s definition of damaged areas.  The Fischer Project <br>neighborhood in Algiers was little damaged.  (A seventh project neighborhood, the St. Thomas <br>Project in the Central City/Garden District, was demolished in 2002, replaced by a Wal-Mart and <br>new predominantly market-rate condominiums.  Therefore the census data from 2000 shown in <br>Table 3 do not reflect the population composition at the time of Katrina.) <br> <br>At the other end of the class spectrum are a number of more advantaged neighborhoods with <br>poverty rates below 10% or unemployment rates below 5%.  In the most heavily impacted <br>planning districts, few neighborhoods meet either criterion.  These include the Lake-<br>Terrace/Lake Oaks neighborhood in Gentilly and the Read Boulevard East neighborhood in New <br>Orleans East.  Most such neighborhoods are in the Lakeview Planning District, which is an area <br>with a small black population, mostly homeowners, and very low rates of poverty and <br>unemployment.  Here only the Lakeshore/Lake Vista neighborhood, adjacent to Lake <br>Pontchartrain, was partly spared. <br> <br>Few residents in the French Quarter, a predominantly white neighborhood with a poverty rate of <br>about 11% and unemployment below 5%, lived in tracts that were flooded. <br> <br>Among other neighborhoods with a national reputation for affluence, the Garden District <br>neighborhood was not flooded and only 40% of the Audubon/University neighborhood (home of <br>Tulane University and Loyola University) was damaged.  <br>

<A name=14></a> <br><b> <br>Policy implications <br></b> <br>The sheer number of people who lived in heavily damaged areas – over 640,000 – is a reminder <br>of the scale of Katrina’s impact.  Because the storm hit large numbers of people of every race <br>and class, it seems likely that public support for policies to assist these people will also cut across <br>race and class lines.  However there was also a substantial disproportionate impact on African <br>Americans and people with fewer resources.  These disparities stem from within the City of New <br>Orleans itself, and more specifically from vulnerability to flooding.  This is a pattern with deep <br>roots, and although Katrina caused the most extensive flooding in memory, prior studies by <br>historians (such as <i>An Unnatural Metropolis</i> by Craig Colten) have demonstrated that both high <br>ground and public investments in drainage and pumping systems consistently worked to the <br>advantage of certain neighborhoods in past storms. <br> <br>There are major variations across the region that are likely to affect the process of recovery.  <br>Damage was extensive on the Mississippi Coast, and the area’s largest single source of <br>employment – casino gambling – was knocked out of operation.  In comparison to New Orleans, <br>however, the number of people living in areas of moderate or greater damage was small, only <br>about 50,000.  And also in contrast to New Orleans, only a small share of these people were <br>black and a majority were homeowners.  It is difficult to assess the importance of race in <br>recovery policy in Mississippi, but in a politically conservative state it could make a big <br>difference that white homeowners constitute the bulk of claimants for state assistance.  Further, <br>these people are easier to serve for several reasons.   <br> <br>
1.  First, they are identifiable and – because they retain an ownership interest in their <br>
properties – they should prove easier for authorities to contact.   <br>
2.  Second, since much of the damage wrought by Katrina in this area was by wind and rain <br>
damage, standard homeowner policies offer substantial private sector coverage of <br>damage losses.  For those with uninsured flood damage, the state government currently <br>expects federal aid to be sufficient to fund payments of $150,000 to individual <br>homeowners. <br>
3.  Third, the low density of housing in this area means that typically even when one’s home <br>
was uninhabitable, there was space for a trailer in the driveway.  Since in addition the <br>loss of electrical power was relatively short-term in Mississippi, and basic public services <br>could be restored within a reasonable time, homeowners in this region more readily met <br>the requirements for a FEMA-provided trailer – space and confirmed utility hookups.   <br>
 <br>In contrast, consider the situation in New Orleans.  More than half the persons in damaged areas <br>were renters, unlikely to be protected in any way by property insurance, and 30% fell below the <br>poverty line and were therefore unlikely to have personal resources to return to the city.  By the <br>end of 2005, power was still unavailable much of the city, and actual connections to electric <br>power required residents to present evidence of inspection by a licensed electrician before power <br>would be restored to an individual home.  The utility company (a subsidiary of the Entergy <br>Corporation) had filed for bankruptcy protection in September. <br> <br>People who previously lived in public housing seem to have the least chances to return, given <br>current policy.  All public housing in the affected areas has been closed (and special barriers <br>
 <br>
14 <br>
<hr>
<A name=15></a>bolted to the doors), and residents have been allotted rental housing assistance in areas where <br>they have relocated for up to 18 months.  Plans for reopening the projects or for constructing new <br>affordable housing have not become public. <br> <br>For many of the same reasons that rebuilding will be facilitated on the Mississippi Coast, the <br>white residents of the City of New Orleans are more likely than black residents to be able to <br>return to their neighborhoods, even if the neighborhood is reopened.  Whites are more likely to <br>be homeowners (55% compared to 42% among African American households), but more <br>important, they are much more likely to have the personal resources to reinvest in their homes or <br>to find a new residence in a difficult housing market.  In the pre-Katrina black population, 35% <br>were below the poverty line and the median household income was only $25,000.  Among <br>whites, only 11% were poor and the median income was more than twice as high – $61,000.  <br>Therefore even among homeowners, blacks are less likely to have the means to rebuild than are <br>whites. <br> <br>There is potential for political coalitions that cut across the racial and class divisions that have <br>helped structure city politics over the decades.  Residents of such very different neighborhoods <br>as Lakeview and the Lower Ninth Ward have a shared interest in short-term assistance programs <br>such as subsidies for temporary housing outside the city.  Up to now few city residents have <br>qualified for FEMA trailers outside their homes because they do not own the home, or there is <br>insufficient space for a trailer, or public utilities remain unavailable.  As long as issues can be <br>framed so that demands are oriented toward FEMA (an external target) or toward demands for <br>services like electricity or schools or police protection that affect all segments of the public, the <br>appearance of unity can be maintained.  The City Council’s repeated stands in favor of <br>rebuilding all parts of the city – a question on which the Council is unlikely to have the final <br>word – is a reflection of this temporary unity. <br> <br>Yet variations across neighborhoods – and across race and class – are likely to support the <br>emergence of a sense of conflicting interests.  In December 2005 conflict took the form of <br>opposition to proposals to locate FEMA trailers in public spaces within neighborhoods that <br>sustained less damage.  In this case the interests of advantaged neighborhoods (advantaged by <br>protection from flooding and by having residents in place to express their views) were in conflict <br>with the interests of absent residents who have no place to return.  Not surprisingly the City <br>Council gave its members veto power over new trailer parks in the areas that they represent.    <br> <br>In the longer term there is likely to be competition between damaged neighborhoods for the <br>supports that will be necessary for rebuilding.  In mid-January 2006, the Bring New Orleans <br>Back Commission (a policy group formed by city government) released a planning report that <br>began to address this question.  The Commission identified some parts of the city as “immediate <br>opportunity areas.” These areas are shaded in yellow on the map in Figure 4.  Compared to the <br>damaged areas shown in Figure 2 above, it is clear that the Commission proposes rebuilding in <br>some areas that were flooded.  They include areas along the river near the central business <br>district, Holy Cross in the Lower Ninth Ward Planning District, and Lakewood/West End and <br>Lakeshore/Lake Vista bordering Lake Pontchartrain.  Generally these are zones where sustained <br>flooding was under about four feet.   <br> <br>The Commission also recommended the designation of large portions of the city as <br>“neighborhood planning” areas.  Within these areas the Commission recommends a temporary <br>
 <br>
15 <br>
<hr>
<A name=16></a>halt on issuance of building permits.  Only where there is evidence within the next four months <br>that residents are committed to returning to each neighborhood in large numbers would <br>rebuilding be approved.   <br> <br> <br>

 <br>
 <br>Source: Bring Back New Orleans Commission, Action Plan for New Orleans: The New <br>American City.  January 11, 2006.  (http://bringneworleansback.org) <br> <br> <br>The precise criteria underlying these designations have not been announced, and the <br>Commission’s recommendations have not been formally adopted.  This is a temporary solution <br>to the political problem that few public officials are willing to state openly that some areas will <br>not be permitted to be resettled.  On its face it leaves the decision to local residents.  Clearly <br>some areas are at risk of being closed to reconstruction.  In January 2006, the full-time <br>population of the city has been estimated at only 150,000.  The analysis in this report suggests <br>that if the future city were limited to the population previously living in zones undamaged by <br>Katrina it would risk losing about 50% of its white residents but more than 80% of its black <br>population.  This is why the continuing question about the hurricane is this: whose city will be <br>rebuilt? <br> <br>
