<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 1 <br>

<A name=2></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
Which entity will the parish designate to coordinate with the Louisiana Land Trust (LLT) for the <br>disposition or redevelopment of properties acquired through the Road Home program?  Parishes can <br>designate a local agency and/or nonprofit for this purpose or request that the Louisiana Land Trust dispose <br>of properties in partnership with the parish and in accordance with the outline set forth in the Parish <br>Redevelopment and Disposition Plan.  If the parish designates a local agency or nonprofit for this purpose, <br>this section of the plan must briefly describe the qualifications and capacity of the organization and <br>individuals responsible for implementing the Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan.   In addition, the <br>legal authority for this entity and a list of the organization’s board members must be attached.   <br> <br><b> </b><br>
      The New Orleans Redevelopment Authority (“NORA”) has been designated by the City of New <br>
Orleans as the exclusive recipient of all Road Home properties.  NORA is a public body corporate and <br>politic, created in 1968 pursuant to LA R.S. 33:4720.55, and the resolution of the Council of the City of New <br>Orleans, evidenced by a certificate signed by the Mayor and Council and registered with the Secretary of <br>State of Louisiana.   NORA exists to help remediate blighted conditions and promote equitable community <br>development.   NORA recently completed a Demonstration Village redevelopment initiative and has plans <br>for another similar program involving approximately 75 properties.  NORA is led by Joseph Williams, its <br>Executive Director, and has a staff of approximately 17 people.  Its Real Estate practice is led by Ommeed <br>Sathe and includes three project managers, two housing inspectors and additional support staff.  Biographies <br>from its key members are available upon request.  <br>
NORA’s board includes the following 11 members all of whom have a wealth of experience in the public <br>
and private sectors:  Chairman Herschel Abbott, Jim Singleton, Paul West, Rob Couhig, James Gray, Karl <br>Connor, Barbara Major, Wayne Woods, Mel Lagarde, Scott Cowen, and Rev. James Brown.  NORA has a <br>number of statutory powers, including the ability to implement community improvement plans and acquire <br>blighted properties, which will help it to implement the vision put forth in this document.  NORA believes <br>these powers are crucial and complementary and intends to utilize them both to implement this document <br>and pursue all of its other traditional goals.  <br><b> <br> <br> <br>2.  PROPOSED REDEVELOPMENT AND DISPOSITION PROCESSES/POLICIES <br> <br></b>Please outline the parish’s redevelopment and disposition processes and policies.  If there is not sufficient <br>space below, the response may be attached as a separate document.  This section must address whether <br>properties will be bundled and auctioned, sold for targeted development, offered to adjacent owners, or <br>reintroduced to the marketplace through other strategies.  These strategies must be carried out in <br>accordance with Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) guidelines (please see attached).   If <br>properties are to be assembled and offered through a competitive process, this section must detail the <br>methods by which the parish will prioritize, evaluate, and select redevelopment proposals.  If the LLT will <br>be directing disposition, the parish must recommend the preferred method for the LLT to follow. If the <br>parish plan includes disposition of properties to individuals, the parish must outline the methods to <br>prioritize requests, assess fair market value, and/or distribute lots for the development of affordable <br>housing.    <br> <br>
<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 2 <br>

<A name=3></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
 <br><b>          The detailed response to question 2 is inserted below this box because it could not fit within <br>this box <br></b> <br>
<b>RESPONSE TO QUESTION 2 </b><br>
<b> <br>DISPOSITION APPROACHES <br> <br></b>NORA has four primary disposition methods it will use to manage the LLT properties: <br> <br>
1.  Lot Next Door program and transfers to individuals <br>2.  Transfers to for-profits and non-profits for development as residential property <br>3.  Utilization of properties as sites for community gardens, urban agriculture and pocket parks <br>4.  Selected use of properties for other uses expounded in neighborhood plans, such as community health centers, small <br>
grocers, and expansion of school and other facilities.  <br>
 <br>NORA is committed to following the principles outlined below in determining which set of approaches is most appropriate for a <br>given neighborhood.  The most important of those principles is the involvement of neighborhoods in all of these decisions.  <br> <br><b>1.  Lot Next Door and transfers to individuals <br></b> <br>
The Lot Next Door (“LND”) is a vital program that respects the sacrifices many people have made in returning to their <br>
neighborhoods and the need to eliminate blighted properties from these neighborhoods.  As currently constituted the program is <br>primarily intended as a way for adjacent landowners to expand their lots, add yards and driveways and alleviate neighboring <br>blight.  Under the LND, notices are sent to adjacent homeowners with homestead exemptions allowing them the opportunity to <br>purchase the adjacent property for fair market value.   If homeowners elect to participate they may not sell the property for five <br>years and must maintain it.    NORA intends to work with neighborhoods to encourage participation in this program as well to <br>identify any properties that the community believes should be used for a different public purpose. NORA will also explore <br>utilizing land swaps and other instruments to give residents in neighborhoods the opportunity to come back and rebuild in <br>clustered areas. <br> <br>
Numerous families are also seeking opportunities to rebuild on safer locations within their neighborhoods.  NORA will <br>
support such desires and, in conjunction with neighborhoods, will look at mechanisms such as land swaps that allow for <br>improved clustering.  At the same time, NORA recognizes that many of these comprehensive land banking strategies are no <br>longer possible citizens have already begun to rebuild on their existing sites and there are only limited financial incentives <br>available.  NORA will work with neighborhoods to identify opportunities to optimize this situation and will provide additional <br>data to help neighborhoods make these decisions.  <br> <br><b>2.  Sales and leases to for-profits and non-profits for development as residential property <br> </b><br>
Katrina destroyed countless housing units and there are needs for new housing in many neighborhoods.  NORA <br>
believes that the magnitude of redevelopment will require harnessing all sectors including both the for-profit and non-profit <br>communities.  NORA also believes that different housing market dynamics will play a role in determining the appropriate <br>mixture of entities.  NORA will work with neighborhoods to determine the appropriate mix of entities and NORA does not <br>believe that either sector should receive a blanket preference. <br> <br><b>3.  Community gardens, urban agriculture and pocket parks <br> </b><br>
The LLT properties are largely scattered urban infill sites that do not naturally lend themselves to transformation into <br>
large greenspaces.  However, many of these properties may hold promise as sites for community gardens, pocket parks and <br>urban agriculture.  These uses can help revitalize a neighborhood, create training opportunities, lower the cost of healthy food <br>and provide a useful alternative to conventional maintenance programs.  NORA intends to work with neighborhoods to identify <br>appropriate sites for these uses.  NORA will also focus on finding reliable entities to actually maintain properties in these <br>conditions.   Finally, NORA intends to utilize input from local experts and other cities’ experience with these programs. <br> <br><b>4.  Other uses </b><br>
<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 3 <br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
 <br>
All of the LLT properties were formerly residential structures and therefore the most common disposition of properties <br>
will be for residential use.  Nevertheless, there will likely be instances where neighborhood wishes and local zoning will permit a <br>property to be used for alternative purposes such as a community health center, a corner grocer or expansion of parking for a <br>school.   NORA believes that these alternative uses are often vital to revitalizing neighborhoods and it will work with <br>neighborhoods to identify opportunities for these uses.  In seeking these opportunities, it will also be guided by the plans created <br>by the neighborhood planning process and the Orleans Parish Recovery and Redevelopment Plan, which outlined many of these <br>possible alternative uses.   <br><b> <br> <br>NORA’S KEY DISPOSITION PRINCIPLES <br></b> <br>
Set forth below are a number of principles that will guide NORA’s disposition of the LLT properties.  These principles lay <br>
out a guiding vision that will be refined in conjunction with neighborhoods, and as the LRA and LLT provide additional <br>information regarding the location of LLT properties and the applicable restrictions imposed by CDBG, HUD and state OCD <br>guidelines.  NORA expects to work in tandem with these entities to achieve any necessary flexibility to carry out the principles <br>presented in this document and support the Orleans Parish Recovery and Redevelopment Plan.<b> <br> </b><br>
 <br>
<b>A.  Community Participation &amp; Neighborhood involvement </b><br>
 <br>
NORA is committed to consulting with neighborhoods before any decisions are reached regarding the disposition of <br>
LLT properties.   NORA is particularly cognizant of the role that planning districts should play in this process.  NORA will <br>solicit feedback from all the planning districts and believes that the plans created by these groups and subsequently incorporated <br>into the Orleans Parish Recovery and Redevelopment Plan approved by the City Council should provide a starting point in <br>defining dispositions strategies for the LLT properties.  NORA will seek to integrate these plans with LRA and CDBG <br>requirements regarding these properties, market analysis regarding what is feasible at different prices, NORA’s own policies and <br>procedures, and any city and state ordinances including the Lot Next Door program.  NORA will also, where appropriate, work <br>with neighborhood groups within these planning districts, particularly for those neighborhoods with significant numbers of LLT <br>properties.  <br>
NORA is in the midst of scheduling initial meetings with these neighborhood groups that will take place between mid-<br>
January and mid-March.  NORA will publish a list of scheduled meetings with neighborhoods on its website and will also reach <br>out to groups in the neighborhood who are listed in its contact database.  NORA will also ask that neighborhood facilitators <br>bring to these meetings all stakeholders from a given community.   <br>
NORA also recognizes that communities need better data to become more deeply involved in the process.  Under the <br>
current Road Home program only properties that have completed closing may be displayed on a parcel level basis.  NORA is <br>working to relax this restriction as it unduly delays providing important information to the community.   Once NORA has <br>received permission, it will provide parcel level maps to help engage neighborhood organizations.  NORA will strive to make <br>these maps available on a regular basis on its website.  <br>
NORA also recognizes that communities need time to deliberate on these issues and at times make difficult choices <br>
regarding the different approaches to take in their neighborhoods.  NORA is attempting to therefore reach out to these groups <br>long before it actually receives any property from the LLT. <br>
Finally, NORA has prepared a redevelopment compact that will help ratify and formalize its commitment to work with <br>
neighborhoods.  A sample of this document will be made available on NORA’s website <br><b> <br>B.  Ensure and require maintenance of LLT properties <br> <br></b><i>Please see the response to question 8  <br></i><b> <br>C.  Support Affordability and Equity </b><br>
Housing costs (including insurance, taxes and the actual constructions costs) have skyrocketed since the storms and <br>
impaired affordability across the income spectrum.  According to our analysis, it takes over 120% of AMI to afford a basic home <br>that costs $150,000.   Rental costs have also dramatically increased since a significant portion of the prior rental housing stock <br>was destroyed in the storm.    These costs are hurting families and reducing the viability of New Orleans.   <br>
To support affordability, NORA intends to sell land for reduced rates where permitted by CDBG and LRA regulations, <br>
as well as channel subsidies and public investments towards these goals. NORA will also support affordability by using its large <br>inventory of holdings to promote innovative and more cost-effective forms of construction.  NORA will also look towards lease-<br>purchase and the utilization of doubles to promote affordability.  Further, NORA will seek to maintain long term affordability of <br>
<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 4 <br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
affordable properties.  NORA is investigating methods such as a community land trust, limited-equity co-ops and other shared <br>appreciation vehicles that ensure properties remain affordable.   <br>
 <br>Inexpensive and even free land, however, will not alone be enough and there must be significant additional subsidies to <br>
create such opportunities. While there are significant federal subsidies, such as Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”), <br>available for groups below 80% of Area Median Income (“AMI”), these subsidies are often insufficient to cover the increase in <br>construction and insurance costs and are generally only available for rental properties.  There is an even more acute gap for <br>individuals making 80%-120% of AMI, as there are few significant subsidies for this population.  This affordability gap is <br>devastating to New Orleans because these are the salaries earned by first responders, teachers, social workers and other crucial <br>community stakeholders.   NORA is committed to seeking out and supporting efforts to create soft-seconds, and other subsidies, <br>to aid in the redevelopment of the LLT properties.    <br>
NORA also recognizes that neighborhoods must be involved in decisions regarding affordable housing.  Each <br>
neighborhood in the city has its own specific concerns and product types that will work for its residents.  Each community also <br>needs to draw back its share of first responder, teachers and similarly situated professionals with moderate incomes.  As with all <br>its decision, NORA will work with neighborhoods and key stakeholders to make specific decisions regarding affordability.  <br>
NORA intends to work with all communities to ensure equity with regard to development opportunities, working with <br>
subcontractors and individual purchasers.  We will strive to use local industries in the redevelopment of the City to ensure that <br>this process creates the maximum benefit.   NORA will encourage participants in this process to contract with DBEs and to hire <br>and train local workers.   NORA will also attempt to involve organizations that represent the disabled, veterans, the homeless <br>and other populations with special needs to ensure that the disposition of LLT properties supports broader equitable goals.  <br>NORA is against racial, religious and other forms of discrimination. <br><b> <br></b><i>Please see the response to question 5 for additional information <br></i><b> <br>D.  Targeted Intervention </b><br>
Checkerboard development (i.e. where only a few homes on each block are addressed in the midst of surrounding <br>
disinvestment) is bad for communities and extremely costly to the city.  The City through the neighborhood planning process <br>and its Recovery Plan has created 17 target zones in which to concentrate the first round of city investments and property <br>dispositions.  NORA has added to this list with a few additional targets such as Public Housing offsites, Ponchartrain Park, <br>Hoffman Triangle and Broadmoor.    By first releasing the properties to one entity (NORA) and concentrating on specific <br>regions, the city can ensure that residential blocks are fully filled, retail options return and returning homeowners have a clear <br>signal from the government regarding the implementation of a sensible redevelopment plan.  Because demand may be limited <br>and the market relatively precarious, it is crucial to employ a focused development approach.  As we complete our targets, <br>NORA will develop additional future projects based on the principles laid out in the Orleans Parish Recovery and <br>Redevelopment Plan and further neighborhood input <br><b> <br>E.  Maximum Clustering of Available Properties </b><br>
It is counterproductive to initiate LLT property development on a block when it remains filled with blight.   Likewise, it <br>
heightens developer interest when there are significant agglomerations of property.  To the extent possible without unduly <br>slowing the overall rate of disposition, it is vital to cluster all available property pipelines within a given area.  Besides the LLT <br>properties, the City of New Orleans has over 15,000 derelict, vacant, tax delinquent and blighted structures (see Exhibit 2 <br>below).   Our goal is to concentrate acquisition of these properties in areas possessing a significant number of LLT properties <br>and then distribute these properties in tandem with the LLT properties.  This strategy will benefit neighborhoods and increase the <br>value of our LLT dispositions. <br> <br><i>EXHIBIT 2: </i><br>

** All figures come from NORA databases and information provided by City of New Orleans and the LLT. <br> <br><b>F.  Prevent Speculation and ensure responsible development </b><br>
Selling LLT properties too rapidly, such as via a single auction, is unproductive as many of the properties will tend to <br>
end up in the hands of speculators and ineffective developers.1   Speculators tend not to maintain lots and structures, have <br>limited community interest and hinder efforts at collective intervention.   When these types of owners fail to comply with local <br>housing standards it is extremely costly to pursue them individually and attempt to repossess their properties.   It also places an <br>added burden on the city’s already overstretched code enforcement division.   Worst of all, salvageable structures often <br>deteriorate in speculators’ hands and end up beyond the point of cost-effective rehabilitation.    <br>
NORA will impede, and hopefully eliminate, speculation by four significant steps: <br>
1)  NORA will create rigorous RFPs that attempt to screen qualified developers from speculators; <br>2)  NORA will distribute property in a gradual and focused way as part of comprehensive development strategies.  It will <br>
therefore create positive incentives for immediate redevelopment rather than for land hoarding;  <br>
3)  NORA will sell property subject to strict development and disposition agreements (“DDA”) that require rapid <br>
redevelopment consistent with the Orleans Parish Recovery and Redevelopment Plan and community planning process.  <br>By proceeding gradually, NORA will have sufficient resources to pursue any candidates that fail to comply with these <br>DDAs; and  <br>
4)  NORA will not continue to sell properties to entities that fail to comply with DDAs. <br> <br>
<i> <br></i><b>G.  Transparency  </b><br>
NORA is fully committed to transparency and has adopted strict policies and procedures to govern the distribution of <br>
property.  We anticipate distributing properties via a hybrid RFQ-highest bid model.  By first soliciting qualifications we will <br>ensure that only qualified entities participate in rebuilding initiatives.  This will help redevelopment occur more quickly, <br>equitably and effectively.  In our previous demonstration village disposition, NORA evaluated 12 categories that included <br>financial capacity, experience in urban communities, innovation, affordability and design.  We coupled this process with a single <br>sealed highest bid amongst qualified participants to ensure that we had an equitable manner of choosing between equally <br>qualified entities.   <br> <br>
NORA is also trying to ensure transparency by posting material publicly and publicizing its neighborhood meetings.   <br>
NORA has posted this draft plan at its website and is posting the written feedback that it received from other entities to this plan.  <br>NORA will also post a response to the oral and written comments it received at its November 28, 2007 public forum.  NORA is <br>also posting a document that describes the content of the Lot Next Door Ordinance and its Neighborhood Redevelopment <br>Compacts.   In addition, NORA will post a schedule of future meetings on its website.  Copies of all these NORA documents <br>will also be available at its offices to allow those without internet access an opportunity to participate.  Once dispositions have <br>begun, NORA will also post information regarding the levels of affordability it has achieved, the number of properties it has <br>disposed of, and the level of participation in the Lot Next Door program.   <br> <br>
NORA will also return email and calls in a timely manner and has a full-time receptionist to answer calls.  It can also be <br>
reached at nora@cityofno.com <br>
 <br>
 <br><b>H.   Promote Homeownership <br> </b><br>
Countless studies have shown that homeowners build more wealth than renters and can become more deeply involved <br>
in their communities.  NORA believes these LLT properties represent an excellent opportunity to create homeownership and will <br>promote that use on these properties.  At the same time, NORA recognizes that certain populations lack the assets or income to <br>                                                             <br>1 For example, under the current tax sale procedures numerous large out of town entities purchase properties in bulk and don’t <br>develop them for years thereby allowing them to slowly deteriorate.   <br>
<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 6 <br>
<hr>
<A name=7></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
qualify for homeownership.  NORA is committed to pursuing subsidies to expand opportunities for homeownership.  NORA will <br>also, in conjunction with neighborhoods, work to make certain properties available for rental housing as well and look to the <br>creation of doubles and other forms of rental properties that can build community wealth.  NORA will also try to ensure that all <br>rental dispositions contain sufficient restriction to ensure that all developments are high quality and well maintained.   <br>
  <br>
<b>I.  Demolish Judiciously </b><br>
Demolition prevents health hazards, eliminates blighted structures and reduces long term maintenance costs.  On the <br>
other hand, the demolition of properties is expensive and most studies have found that it takes longer for vacant lots to be <br>redeveloped than existing structures.2  Taken together, NORA believes that demolition should be done in the following cases: 1) <br>on all structures in imminent danger of collapse or that are in need of extensive renovation or hazard mitigation, 2) areas which <br>are likely to be longer term development priorities, and 3) on properties being transitioned to alternative uses (community <br>garden, lot next door, etc).  NORA also believes that we should be particularly careful in historic districts, and has made <br>arrangements with HDLC to inspect LLT properties in such areas.  Our current estimates suggest that between 25%-35% of <br>properties with structures will require demolition.  We are working to maximize the amount of such demolition that is covered <br>by FEMA.   <br> <br>
 <br>
<b>J.  Conformity with Long Term Strategic Recovery Plan  </b><br>
NORA is committed to the City of New Orleans’ Long Term Strategic Recovery Plan and will seek to further the goals <br>
laid out therein.  As described above, NORA believes in a targeted clustered strategy and intends to initiate many of its early <br>dispositions in the 17 target zones.  We will also endeavor to coordinate our dispositions with infrastructure and other <br>developments described in the Recovery Plan.   <br>
<i>Please see Questions 3 and 7 on the application for additional information regarding conformity of the Disposition </i><br>
<i>Plan with the Recovery Plan.</i>   <br> <br><b> <br>K.  Multiple Scales </b><br>
NORA intends to work with both large and small developers as well as individuals and public agencies.  The exact mix <br>
will be determined by funding availability, the size of a dispositions, the desired form of development and NORA’s own internal <br>administrative capacity.  NORA also intends to sell properties to both non-profit and for profit entities. <br><b> <br>L.  Green Building <br> </b><br>
All dispositions will be made in conformity with the existing housing code and any green building or energy saving <br>
ordinances.  NORA will also endeavor to ensure that development and rehabilitation utilizes green building and energy reduction <br>features.  It will also endeavor to reduce the long-term maintenance costs of any property of which it disposes.  NORA will seek <br>out green building experts and universities to help shape its approach to green building.  NORA will also try to make these <br>experts available to neighborhoods so that they can assess the ramifications of different green building choices.  <br><b> <br> <br>M.  Safety and Elevation <br> </b><br>
It is vital that New Orleans rebuild safer, stronger and smarter.  It is vital that newly constructed properties on LLT land <br>
(and for that matter all sites NORA acquires through any of its pipelines) are sufficiently elevated to exceed required base flood <br>elevations and that rehabbed structures also adopt sensible mitigation techniques.  In addition, where feasible, construction <br>should use materials and designs to limit the damaging effects of wind and flooding.  To assist in these efforts, NORA will urge <br>Chairman Don Powell, FEMA and the governor to release Hazard Mitigation funds and to waive unduly burdensome restrictions <br>that have impeded their use.  NORA in conjunction with neighborhoods will also attempt to promote land swaps and rights of <br>first refusal that can give people incentives and opportunities to move to safer areas.    <br><b> <br> <br>N.  Historic Preservation <br> <br></b>                                                             <br>2 An analysis in Philadelphia found that only 7% of vacant lots were successfully redeveloped within 15 years, where as 40% of <br>blighted structures were redeveloped.  Conversations with housing officials in NY during the 70’s suggested similar results as <br>well.  <br>

New Orleans has a unique and wonderful historic legacy that includes its architecture and buildings.  NORA, as stated <br>
above, will seek to demolish judiciously and take efforts to ensure that salvageable historic structures are preserved where <br>feasible.  NORA also recognizes that it is potentially subject to an agreement executed by the Office of Community <br>Development (“OCD”) regarding treatment of historic structures under section 106.  NORA will work with OCD and both state <br>and local preservation organizations to identify appropriate protocols<b>.   <br> <br>O.   Collaborations <br> </b><br>
There are countless issues involved in the redevelopment, management and disposition of these properties.  NORA is <br>
committed to working with neighborhoods and planning districts to implement its strategies.  It also believes that these efforts <br>can be aided by leveraging significant existing expertise on a variety of topics.  NORA will work to engage outside experts on <br>topics ranging from green building, land banking, building practices, and training and evaluating contractors. <br><b> <br>P.  Homeowner’s Insurance <br> </b><br>
The cost of homeowner’s insurance has skyrocketed and is negatively impacting every form of development in the city.  <br>
NORA will investigate mechanisms to reduce these costs including acquiring global insurance for all LLT properties.  NORA <br>will also seek to ensure that these properties are built with features that mitigate the effects of storms and should therefore entitle <br>owners to greater discounts from insurers.  <br> <br><b>Q.  Coordination and Flexibility <br> <br> </b><br>
The principles laid out in this document are a guiding vision for the disposition of the LLT properties.  To actually <br>
achieve this vision will require additional resources and additional flexibility from traditional rules governing CDBG funds.  <br>NORA intends to work with the LRA, LLT, OCD and HUD to ensure that it receives the requisite financial resources and <br>administrative flexibility.  The Disposition Plan, itself will also become more specific and concrete as additional clarity is <br>achieved on these topics.  To enhance the vision of this document, each of the aforementioned entities will also need to utilize <br>their complete independent legal and political authorities as well, and nothing contained herein should be considered a limitation <br>of those authorities.   <br><b> <br>DEMAND ANALYSIS  <br></b> <br><b>A.  Market Rate Demand <br></b> <br>
The disposition of LLT properties and many other recovery efforts are sensitive to the overall demand for housing and <br>
property in the City of New Orleans.  As we dispose of properties we intend to be aggressive, yet sensitive to the overall market <br>demand and inventory levels.  Broadly speaking, overall demand has three key components: 1) market-rate demand, 2) non-<br>profit and subsidized demand, 3) and non-housing demand.   Market rate demand is significantly influenced by the price of <br>housing (which in turn is driven by construction costs), the presence of good schools and safe neighborhoods, and the <br>availability of well-paying jobs.  In New Orleans, there is already almost 12 months of inventory on the market based on current <br>prices and sales level.3   <br>
In terms of construction costs, the typical shotgun home, which is approximately 1000-1200 sf, now costs almost <br>
$150,000 to develop and over $8000 per year to maintain and insure (please see exhibit A).4  The situation is slightly less dire <br>with rehabilitation; however the long delay since the storm has rendered many LLT properties significantly damaged, and <br>increased the required rehabilitation costs of these properties close to the cost of new construction.5   <br>
To afford a 150,000 home, conventional underwriting would require an income of over $60,000.   At this price point, <br>
market demand is limited and even giving away the land for free will not alter these dynamics.  To rectify this shortfall, we are <br>seeking increased support for soft-seconds and other housing subsidies at both the state and federal levels. 6  More generally, we <br>need to make a concerted effort to draw back many of the families who have left New Orleans.    <br> <br><b>B.  Non-Profit Demand</b><i> <br></i>                                                             <br>3 These figures were provided by conversations with local realtors and various consultants.   <br>4 Please see the spreadsheet Exhibit for a more detailed description of costs.  All figures in that spreadsheet come from extensive <br>interviews with a variety of developers, contractors and underwriters. <br>5 Rehabilitation runs approximately $60-$80 psf vs. $105+ psf for new construction.  These figures are for hard costs only and <br>will vary based on the extent of damage.   <br>6 This includes both the proposal put forward by the Jeremiah Group and the pending federal legislation §1668 <br>

<A name=9></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
Besides market-rate demand there is significant pent-up demand from non-profits and other organizations with federal <br>
subsidies such as developers of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) projects.   It is important to recognize that many <br>organizations’ publicly stated demand levels are for development that occurs across a number of years, especially those relying <br>on annual installments of subsidies or donations.  In addition, many organizations have already made sizable acquisitions that <br>will consume their short-term development resources.  In preparing our financial models we have therefore looked carefully at <br>the annual demand for LLT properties.  Our analysis suggests that it is vital that NORA allocate properties in a steady manner <br>consistent with market demand. It is also important that NORA integrate these non-profit developments with market-rate units to <br>create mixed-income communities, as stressed in the city’s neighborhood planning process.   <br><i> <br></i><b>C.  Non-Development Demand</b><i> <br></i> <br>
Another source of demand for properties is for merger with homeowner’s existing lots, such as through the City’s <br>
upcoming Lot Next Door Program.  In addition, there is demand for community gardens and pocket parks.  There may even be <br>possibilities for urban agriculture or other economic development functions.     These types of transactions are less impacted by <br>the general dynamics of the housing market because these lots are used for non-development purposes.  The drawback to this <br>source of demand is that the process requires significant administration to complete individual transactions and may require <br>initial capital investments in the case of community gardens.  NORA is currently working on these innovative approaches and <br>analyzing their eligibility under traditional CDBG regulations.  <br><b> <br>LLT TRANSFER APPROACH  <br>A.  NORA to be Exclusive Recipient <br> <br> </b><br>
Making NORA the sole recipient of all LLT properties in Orleans Parish will provide four significant benefits:  <br>
 <br>
1)  It allows NORA to cluster LLT properties with its numerous other property pipelines (blighted, adjudicated, market <br>
acquisitions) and finally make the distribution of property more coherent. <br>
 <br>
2)  It ensures that all development occurs in compliance with the city’s comprehensive planning process and target zone <br>
strategy.  NORA’s central role will also ensure that development coincides with the city’s planned investments in <br>infrastructure, schools and public safety. <br>
 <br>
3)  Centralizing property with NORA allows development to proceed at a consistent and sustainable pace that does not <br>
flood the market.  <br>
 <br>
4)  NORA’s experience with CDBG compliance and monitoring will provide assurances that all dispositions are consistent <br>
with CDBG regulations.    <br>
 <br><b>B.  Support for Maintenance <br> </b><br>
As it disposes of properties, NORA will incur significant maintenance, security and insurance costs.  Our current <br>
budget suggests that these costs, plus the administrative costs involved in managing these properties, will exceed the proceeds <br>we recoup from the sale of these properties, particularly in the short term when we will incur the largest maintenance burden.  <br>We therefore request that the state allow proceeds from the property dispositions to go towards these necessary maintenance and <br>administrative costs and that the state provide NORA with additional funds equal to the anticipated excess cost of maintenance.   <br>One significant benefit to NORA’s deliberate and clustered distribution of properties is that the LLT properties may appreciate <br>in value over time.  NORA intends to share this future appreciation with the LLT. <br>
<i> </i><br>
<b>C.  Clarity on Future Disbursements  <br> </b><br>
Our current understanding is that LLT has already identified close to 4000 properties in Orleans parish that may be <br>
available for transfer to NORA by the middle of 2008.  It is also our understanding that another 3000-4000 properties may still <br>be in the pipeline.  As we determine short and long term priorities and initiate clustering efforts, it is crucial that we have clear <br>data on where these properties will be located within the city.  We ask that the LLT provide enhanced information regarding the <br>overall distribution of these properties prior to formal transfer.  <br>

<A name=11></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
       In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Mayor of the City of New Orleans, the <br>
President of the City Council for the City of New Orleans, the Commissioner of the City Planning <br>Commission for Orleans Parish, and the Greater New Orleans and Community Support Organization <br>Foundations entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on August 28, 2006 that established the “Unified <br>New Orleans Neighborhood Recovery Planning Process” as the means of consolidating post-disaster citizen, <br>governmental, and private sector recovery and redevelopment plans into a single Parish long-term <br>community recovery plan known as the “Orleans Parish Recovery and Redevelopment Plan (“the Plan”).   <br>
The Plan is a legal document established to guide Parish governmental policies and was developed <br>
pursuant to La R.S., 33:101, et seq., which authorizes the Parish to make and adopt plans in the interest of <br>public safety and the continued progress and growth of the community, and the Home Rule Charter of the <br>City of New Orleans, which provides under Section 5-402(3)(e) that the City Planning Commission shall <br>prepare and recommend to the New Orleans City Council, “[p]lans for the replanning, improvement, and <br>reconstruction of neighborhood and community centers and of areas or districts destroyed or seriously <br>damaged by fire, earthquake, flood or other disasters.” <br>
The Plan was approved by the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA), pursuant to the requirements <br>
established by that entity under its “Long-Term Community Recovery Program,” which is the principle State <br>recovery-funding vehicle available to local governments for projects aimed at accommodating long-term <br>redevelopment of the community.  More specifically, the Plan includes projects for funding that are “selected <br>by the parishes based on local priorities;” “demonstrate broad-based support from the local community, as <br>indicated by inclusion in a broadly accepted recovery plan, or similar mechanism;” and “include direct <br>benefits to the most affected municipalities and communities or have the agreement from the elected officials <br>of the most impacted municipalities.”  As the initial phase of this program the city has enumerated a recovery <br>strategy that includes a focus on 17 Target Recovery Areas. The Disposition Plan described in this document <br>has been created to reflect the Plan and shares its core principles with regard to the selection of projects.  The <br>Disposition Plan attempts to implement the Plan in light of current market conditions and the overall <br>inventory of properties.   It shares a focus on clustered, targeted development and will support the <br>redevelopment slated for the Target Recovery Areas. <br> <br><b> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>4.  METHODS TO BE USED TO ENSURE COMFORMANCE WITH CDBG GUIDELINES  <br> <br></b>This section of the plan must provide information regarding parish’s redevelopment program structure and <br>qualifications of staff responsible for ensuring CDBG Guidelines are met.  If work is to be contracted out, <br>please describe the proposed method of procurement and selection criteria.   <br> <br>
<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 11 <br>

<b> </b><br>
      NORA has traditionally been funded by CDBG and has a long history of monitoring its own <br>
compliance with these regulations.  NORA’s current director of finance and administration, Sheri <br>Labranche-Jackson has over 10 years experience.  She is assisted by NORA’s general counsel and two <br>additional lawyers.  NORA compliance personnel will include a dedicated accountant and an additional <br>support staff member.  All of these individuals have experience with CDBG compliance and will insure that <br>all NORA activities comply with these guidelines.   Biographies of NORA’s key personnel are available <br>upon request. <br>
CDBG guidelines are ambiguous in a number of areas that will play a crucial role on the final <br>
disposition of properties and the exact scope of the plan.  Among other issues, CDBG guidelines require <br>that the key activities contained herein should qualify as “National Objectives (Elimination of Blight, LMI <br>Benefit, Urgent Need).”  These national objectives have been developed in the context of far smaller <br>program and it is not clear how they apply to the recovery context.  Among the questions NORA is seeking <br>clarity from HUD are: (1) whether properties can be sold below appraised value for populations other than <br>those making below 80% of AMI, (2) whether costs and proceeds can be treated in bulk, and (3) whether <br>alternative dispositions such as Lot Next Door and urban agriculture are permitted under CDBG guidelines <br>if the properties are not sold for appraised value.  To resolve these questions, NORA, the LRA, LLT and <br>City are all in on-going discussions with HUD. <br> <br><b> <br> <br>5.  AFFORDABLE HOUSING <br> <br></b>This section of the plan must describe the methods and redevelopment policies to be used by the parish in <br>order to ensure that 25% of all properties are redeveloped for affordable housing in accordance with the <br>requirements outlined in Action Plan Amendment 14.  <br> <br>
      NORA intends to balance its disposition of properties across the economic spectrum and is <br>
committed to exceeding the LRA’s goal that 25% of developed properties be redeveloped for affordable <br>housing.  NORA’s current goal is that 25% of developed properties will support affordable residential <br>homeownership, with additional properties being utilized to provide affordable rental housing.  In addition, <br>numerous other properties will be directed to families making between 80%-120% of AMI, who are also in <br>need of more affordable housing.  Where feasible under CDBG guidelines, NORA may elect to sell <br>properties below fair market value if it supports the creation of affordable housing.   In structuring these <br>programs, NORA will try, to the extent legally permitted, to create opportunities for first responders, police <br>and firefighters, teachers and others involved in the recovery effort.   NORA also intends to work closely <br>neighborhoods to identify the appropriate scope of affordable programs for each neighborhood.  As NORA <br>has stressed above, one size does not fit all and all dispositions must be neighborhood specific.  <br>
 In these goals NORA is aided by an active non-profit and subsidized development community that <br>
targets low-income individuals and often brings significant capital to redevelopment initiatives.  These non-<br>profits use charitable funds and subsidies to ensure that their products are affordable to a variety of different <br>end-users.   NORA is actively seeking its own subsidies, including funds for soft seconds, as well as <br>supporting community groups such as the Jeremiah Group in their efforts to secure such subsidies.  These <br>subsidies are crucial to helping make dispositions more affordable and equitable.    <br>
All NORA dispositions will be subject to contractual agreements that will require non-profits and other <br>
developers to comply with any representations they make regarding affordability and as well any additional <br>requirements imposed by CDBG guidelines and Action Plan Amendment 14.   Please see question 2 for <br>additional information on affordability measures.   <br>

 <br>
 <br><b> <br> <br>6.  CONVERSION OF PROPERTY TO GREENSPACE  <br> <br></b>It is anticipated that funding will become available from the FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program <br>(HMGP) for properties acquired by the LLT.  HMGP funding can be used for reimbursement of costs <br>associated with acquiring properties that risk future damage when those properties are converted to <br>greenspace in perpetuity.  This section of the plan must describe the method by which the parish will <br>identify these greenspace areas and include timelines for the conversion of these properties.   <br> <br> <br>
      Due to their geographically scattered locations, most LLT properties will not be suitable to <br>
provide significant contiguous green space.  Instead, where feasible and supported by the neighborhood, <br>NORA will attempt to create community gardens and urban agriculture initiatives with a small portion of <br>the LLT properties.   These initiatives will be pursued with simultaneous investments into housing and <br>redevelopment to help revitalize our neighborhoods.  Through the Lot Next Door program, a number of <br>properties will also be transformed into yards and open space.  <br>
The Orleans Parish Long Term Recovery Plan provides guidance on those areas of the city that are most <br>
in need of Hazard Mitigation.  This guidance is still being refined in light of on-going rehabilitation to New <br>Orleans’ infrastructure and its levees.  Together with NORA, the city will articulate a framework for <br>determining which properties, if any, are in regions that are suited for permanent long-term mitigation.  <br>NORA and the City will also work together to determine if HPMG funds can support redevelopment and <br>maintenance activities other than permanent relocation, including raised elevations. <br> <br>

<b> <br> <br>7.  CONFORMING TO RECOVERY AND REBUILDING PRINCIPLES  <br> <br></b>This section of the plan must describe how the parish’s redevelopment and disposition plan addresses the <br>following five principles for recovery and rebuilding as recommended by the APA/AIA and adopted by the <br>Louisiana Recovery Authority Board on December 1, 2005: <br> <br> <br>
-Create infrastructure that supports recovery by restoring confidence, enhancing the quality of life, <br>
 <br>
and withstanding future disasters; <br>
 <br> <br>
-Promote economic growth that benefits everyone; <br>
 <br> <br>
-Provide public services that enhance the quality of life for everyone; <br>
 <br> <br>
-Pursue policies that promote a healthy environment; <br>
 <br> <br>
-Promote planning and design of communities that advance livability. <br>
 <br> <br>      The NORA LLT Property Disposition Plan is based directly on the strategies and priorities codified <br>in the “Orleans Parish Recovery and Redevelopment Plan” (“the Plan”), which in itself is a citizen-<br>generated statement of public policy for the physical redevelopment of Orleans Parish housing, <br>infrastructure, flood control, public space, schools, medical facilities, commercial property, economic, <br>social and cultural networks. As such, both the NORA Disposition Plan and the overall Parish recovery plan <br>are action-oriented policymaking guides that outlines projects, procedures and implementation strategies for <br>use among Parish governmental entities that are charged with carrying out recovery-related related <br>functions on behalf of the citizens of Orleans Parish.  In addition, these plans are civic tools to help guide <br>the repair and rebuilding of New Orleans in a rational way that creates stability and paves the way for future <br>growth and prosperity. They provide a systematic approach to repairing and rebuilding the damage caused <br>by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in an expeditious and measured timeframe that accommodates the <br>infrastructure and essential services needs of current residents, while planning for their expansion as new <br>citizens establish residence in the Parish over the coming years. <br> <br>The Plans are also general policy planning guides that should be used by Parish governmental entities to <br>structure and enable the development of more detailed, situation-specific policies, programs, and projects <br>that contribute to the recovery of Orleans Parish.  In so doing, the Plans focus primarily on programmatic <br>strategies, capital projects, and intergovernmental procedures aimed at remedying economic and physical <br>damage within the Parish attributed to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and establishing hazard mitigation <br>systems to reduce the risk of future harm.  Unlike traditional master plans, the Plans are intended as a means <br>of establishing programs and projects within a short timeframe, ranging from immediate application to <br>implementation within five years. <br> <br>Within this framework, the Plans mandate roles, responsibilities, and procedures for <br>coordination among Parish governmental  entities  that  will coordinate major aspects of the recommended <br>recovery programs and projects by virtue of their organizational duties.  In addition, the Plans detail non-<br>
<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 14 <br>
<hr>
<A name=15></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
mandatory financial management and implementation strategies that should be referenced and utilized to the <br>extent practicable by all Parish governmental entities as they develop programs and projects that impact <br>overall recovery within Orleans Parish; particularly when those governmental actions influence the <br>restoration or improvement of physical Parish assets, including but not limited to residential housing; <br>commercial property; streets; water, sewerage and drainage systems; public schools; public safety; public <br>parks, libraries, and cultural facilities.  <br> <br>The Plans also provide a strategic framework for maximizing public financing and private investment <br>towards Parish recovery projects.  Specifically, the Plans detail major sources of federal and state funds that <br>are available for disaster-recovery related projects and presents strategies for how to leverage those funds <br>and better apply them to prioritized Parish recovery projects.  The Plans outline strategies for targeted <br>utilization of private sector monies, including insurance proceeds and investment dollars, in complementing <br>publicly financed capital projects.  Finally, the Plans detail currently unfunded recovery programs and <br>projects that should serve as basis for additional future funding requests from the State, the federal <br>government or other entities. <br> <br><b> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>8.  PARISH STRATEGY FOR PROPERTY INSURANCE, MAINTENANCE, AND SECURITY  <br> <br></b>Provide detail regarding the parish strategy for insuring, maintaining, and securing Louisiana Land Title <br>properties until property disposition.   If non-profit services will be utilized for these efforts, please provide <br>information about the non-profit organization’s capacity.  If the parish elects not to receive the LLT <br>properties, please indicate that the Louisiana Land Trust will be responsible for these items.  It is important <br>to note that the parish will be required to track program income generated from property disposition and <br>must adopt the Louisiana Land Trust’s methods for tracking costs per property.  (Please see attached <br>guidelines).    <br><b> </b><br>
<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 15 <br>
<hr>
<A name=16></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
      Please see attached budget for greater detail.  That budget is meant to be illustrative rather <br>
than prescriptive.  NORA will seek to move properties as quickly as can be done so in a responsible manner <br>that is sensitive to market demand.    <br>
Based on figures provided by the LLT, NORA estimates that maintenance, security and insurance <br>
will range from $2000-$3000 per year on a typical property. Based on initial estimates, New Orleans is <br>slated to eventually receive between 6,000-9,000 properties from the LLT.  This would suggest that NORA <br>will require $15-$25 million annually to maintain these properties.  Clearly, the total cost of maintenance <br>will decline as properties are sold, rehabilitated, and demolished.  However, as the plan set forth above <br>describes, it would be extremely foolish to dump properties on to the market to avoid maintenance and <br>security costs.  In particular if there is no active redevelopment/rehabilitation market, property owners are <br>likely to retain properties but not maintain or develop them.  By selling properties more quickly than the <br>market can absorb them, NORA would simply shift the burden of maintenance to the City’s code <br>enforcement department.   NORA also has the resources to develop alternative maintenance programs and <br>to support non-development outcomes such as the Lot Next Door program.  Lot Next Door will be <br>particularly vital in reducing maintenance costs and NORA intends to pursue it vigorously. <br> <br>
NORA is requesting that the State, as the creator of the Road Home program, help bear these <br>
maintenance and security costs, particularly in the short-term when the burden will be its greatest.  As the <br>owner of these properties, NORA will agree to manage the actual maintenance efforts, but expects <br>significant funding for this maintenance to come from a combination of direct appropriation and the <br>redirection of proceeds from the sale of property into these activities.  As noted above, given the overall <br>weakness in the market, it is unlikely that proceeds will cover all costs and NORA takes these properties <br>with the explicit understanding that the LLT or State of Louisiana will help fill this gap.    <br>
 <br>The attached budget estimates the amount of unfunded maintenance liabilities that NORA faces.  <br>
NORA believes that the state should provide a one-time payment to cover this shortfall.  These funds would <br>be placed into trust to maintain the LLT properties as they are disposed over time.   NORA also wants to <br>stress that funding to support maintenance of these properties should not come at the expense of providing <br>appropriate grants to applicants.  In the event that there were unexpected profits, NORA would willingly <br>share those with the state to compensate it for its initial investment.  These profits could be used to fill gaps <br>in the road home program and, in the event the Road Home program is fully funded, they could provide <br>additional resources to help the storm damaged neighborhoods. <br>
 <br>
 <br><b> <br> <br> <br>9.  REDEVELOPMENT AND DISPOSITION TIMELINE <br> <br></b>Provide a timeline for the redevelopment and/or disposition of parish properties.   <br> <br>
<i>Parish Redevelopment &amp; Disposition Plan -</i> 16 <br>
<hr>
<A name=17></a><b>Parish Redevelopment and Disposition Plan  <br>For Louisiana Land Trust Properties </b><br>
<b> </b><br>
      As the recipient of LLT properties, NORA anticipates that it will receive close to 4000 <br>
properties by the beginning of 2008, with an additional 2,000-5,000 to follow throughout the year.  In <br>addition, there are over 10,000 properties that have been formally designated as blighted, adjudicated and <br>tax sale eligible and by some estimates there are more than 15,000 additional units in substandard <br>conditions.  For redevelopment to occur successfully these various substandard properties must be <br>addressed in tandem with the LLT properties and they will absorb a portion of the available demand.   This <br>in turn means that it will take a number of years for NORA to sell or otherwise dispose of the LLT <br>properties.   <br>
NORA’s disposition speed will also be significantly driven by market conditions.  By current estimates <br>
there are close to 12 months of property on the market at current sales rates.  If NORA were to place too <br>much unabsorbed property onto the market it could drastically disrupt the current sales market.   In addition, <br>the currently inflated price of construction and insurance renders it extremely difficult for a family making <br>even 100% of AMI to qualify to purchase new construction.  As a result, New Orleans, somewhat <br>paradoxically, has limits on the demand for new construction at market rates.  To create demand, housing <br>must be subsidized either by reducing its cost of production or the ability of consumer’s to afford it.   <br>
Our objective is to meet the following benchmarks during our first year of operation (which we <br>
anticipate will begin in the spring of next year when we receive our first LLT properties):  <br>
a.  Offer 500-1000 properties through the Lot Next Door program, with hopefully a participation <br>
rate of 15% <br>
b.  Bundle and sell approximately 400-500 properties for market rate development sites for new <br>
construction and rehab, of which 60-75% will be LLT properties <br>
c.  Bundle and sell approximately 400-500 properties for affordable and working-class housing, of <br>
which 60-75% will be LLT properties <br>
d.  Create long-term maintenance solutions/open space - including slow-growing grass, community <br>
gardens and urban agriculture - for 100 properties, all of which will be LLT properties <br>
e.  If and when demand grows, or construction costs shrink, we will be able to expand this program   <br>
 <br>
If we succeed at these targets, approximately 800 properties a year will reach a final resolution.  That <br>
suggests it will take 9-10 years to fully return the LLT properties to commerce.  Please also see attached <br>budget for a more detailed timeline.  Please note that all projections are subject to revision once we receive <br>greater clarity on the location of these properties and when they will be turned over.  Our objective is to <br>move rapidly and responsibly. <br> <br><b> <br> <br> <br> <br>10.  LOCAL/REGIONAL COMMITMENT AND INVOLVEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT <br>OF THE REDEVELOPMENT AND DISPOSITION PLAN  <br> <br></b>Briefly describe the local and/or regional commitment to the project (i.e. level of participation of local <br>officials, business leaders, neighborhoods, and other parish related groups).

       <br>
NORA conducted a public forum to discuss its plan for redevelopment and disposition of the LLT <br>properties on November 28th.  This forum was extremely well attended and the comments provided at that <br>meeting have been incorporated into this document.  NORA has also posted a response to all comments on <br>its website.  Among the key themes in that forum was a need for NORA to fully specify the process of <br>community engagement it would undertake.  These steps are outlined below.  <br> <br>NORA is committed to consulting with neighborhoods before any decisions are reached regarding the <br>disposition of LLT properties.   NORA is particularly cognizant of the role that planning districts should <br>play in this process.  NORA will solicit feedback from all the planning districts and believes that the plans <br>created by these groups as part of the neighborhood planning process and adopted as part of the Orleans <br>Parish Recovery and Redevelopment Plan should provide a starting point in defining dispositions strategies <br>for the LLT properties.  NORA will seek to integrate these plans with LRA and CDBG requirements <br>regarding these properties, market analysis regarding what is feasible at different prices, NORA’s own <br>policies and procedures, and any city and state ordinances, including the Lot Next Door program.  NORA <br>will also, where appropriate, seek to work with neighborhood groups within these planning districts, <br>particularly for those neighborhoods with significant numbers of properties.  The Orleans Parish Recovery <br>and Redevelopment Plan was the subject of intense community participation and shapes the NORA <br>Disposition Plan with regard to LLT properties.  Please see Questions 3 and 7 for a complete description of <br>the Recovery Plan.   NORA is committed to ensuring that all dispositions conform to the Recovery Plan.   <br>
 <br>Once NORA has a more accurate understanding of all available property pipelines – including LLT, <br>
blighted and adjudicated properties – it will share that information with neighborhoods groups to identify <br>potential comprehensive disposition strategies.  It will also attempt to create Neighborhood Redevelopment <br>Compacts, where applicable, to formalize its relationship with the community.    In anticipation of receiving <br>the LLT properties NORA is actively pursuing a program of community engagement, which it intends to <br>continue.  <br> <br><b> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>11.

      NORA met with the City Council’s Recovery Committee on December 4 and the entire council <br>was presented the plan on December 6.  The plan was approved by the full Council on December 6th.  <br>In the course of its recovery efforts NORA has had contact with individual council members and its <br>disposition plan reflects these earlier conversations. <br>
