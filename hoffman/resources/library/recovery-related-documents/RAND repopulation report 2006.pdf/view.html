<A name=5></a>PREFACE <br>
What the future size and composition of the population of New Orleans will be in the aftermath of <br>
Hurricane Katrina is a topic of intense interest and discussion among current and displaced residents of the <br>
city; among policymakers in the City of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the federal government; <br>
and within the general public. This report presents population estimates for New Orleans three months, six <br>
months, one year, and three years after Hurricane Katrina. <br>
This report was prepared after consultation with New Orleans leaders in the aftermath of Hurricane <br>
Katrina and was done specifically to support the efforts of the Bring New Orleans Back Commission. <br>
Projections of the future population of New Orleans are essential to the work of the Commission’s <br>
subcommittees for planning, infrastructure, and sustainability. <br>
The work for this report was carried out between late November 2005 and early January 2006 and <br>
reflects the situation in New Orleans through that time. Changes and further developments in the situation <br>
since then are not reflected in this report. <br>
The study was conducted through the RAND Labor and Population Program, which examines issues <br>
involving U.S. labor markets, the demographics of families and children, social welfare policy, the social <br>
and economic functioning of the elderly, and economic and social change in developing countries. This <br>
report is being released jointly by the Labor and Population Program and the RAND Gulf States Policy <br>
Institute. The research results from the RAND Corporation’s continuing program of self-initiated research. <br>
Support for such research is provided, in part, by donors and by the independent research and <br>
development provisions of RAND’s contracts for the operation of its U.S. Department of Defense federally <br>
funded research and development centers. <br>

THE RAND GULF STATES POLICY INSTITUTE (RGSPI) <br>
The RAND Gulf States Policy Institute (RGSPI) is a collaboration among RAND and seven gulf <br>
universities (Jackson State University, Tulane University, Tuskegee University, University of New Orleans, <br>
University of South Alabama, University of Southern Mississippi, and Xavier University) to develop a long-<br>
- iii -<br>
<hr>
<A name=6></a>term vision and strategy to help build a better future for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama in the wake of <br>
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Institute’s mission is to benefit the Gulf States region by providing officials <br>
in government, nonprofits, and the private sector with the highest quality of analysis to help them not just to <br>
rebuild what the hurricanes destroyed, but to build a better and more prosperous future. <br>
RGSPI is housed at the RAND Corporation, an international nonprofit research organization with a <br>
reputation for rigorous and objective analysis and effective solutions. <br>

INTRODUCTION <br>
Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Louisiana, on August 29, 2005. The city suffered moderate <br>
damage from the hurricane, but substantially more harm from extensive flooding caused by breaks in <br>
several levees. Thousands of residents had fled the city in advance of the hurricane, and virtually all of the <br>
remaining residents were evacuated in the week following the hurricane. The city’s population, estimated at <br>
485,000 in 2000, was reduced to fewer than several thousand by the end of the first week of September <br>
2005. <br>
In November 2005, RAND was asked by New Orleans city leaders to estimate the repopulation of <br>
the city in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Bring New Orleans Back Commission needed estimates <br>
of the city’s population in the immediate future (the next three to six months) and the near-term future (the <br>
next one to three years) to guide the redevelopment planning process. The study, completed in early <br>
January 2006, draws on the best available information at the time and documents extensively and in detail <br>
the methodology and assumptions used. Nevertheless, it was constrained by the urgent need for results, by <br>
limited data availability, and by the considerable uncertainty that surrounded the entire post-Katrina <br>
situation in New Orleans and the region. <br>
APPROACH <br>
Our estimates are guided by a conceptual framework based on the costs and benefits of migration <br>
and on the role of social networks and physical constraints. Damage to housing currently appears to be the <br>
most significant obstacle to repopulation, and the key assumption of our population estimates is that the rate <br>
of repair or reconstruction for flood-damaged dwellings will be the major determinant of the future <br>
population of New Orleans. There are likely to be substantial differences in housing habitability and the <br>
amount of time required to return damaged dwellings to a habitable state according to the depth and <br>
duration of flooding and characteristics of the dwelling. Other factors likely to shape the repopulation of <br>
New Orleans include the provision of basic services and infrastructure, storm protection and flood control, <br>
employment, schools and colleges, and social networks. <br>
Given the determination that housing habitability is the key driver of the future population of New <br>
Orleans, we developed an equation that yields estimates of the future population of New Orleans for four <br>
points in time based on estimates of housing habitability. Those estimates are the product of the two terms <br>
in that equation: (1) an estimate of the pre-Katrina population by the condition of its housing <i>after</i> Katrina, <br>
organized into the four damage categories; and (2) an estimate of future repopulation rates for the four <br>
damage categories at the four points in time. <br>

<hr>
<A name=14></a>RESULTS <br>
Pre-Katrina Population Estimates Based on Post-Katrina Housing Habitability <br>
We assumed that flood damage to housing was directly related to the depth of the floodwater. We <br>
first classified all dwellings in New Orleans according to the extent of the damage they sustained based on <br>
the maximum depth of floodwater. Data on dwellings and population by block, for each of the 10,181 <br>
census blocks in New Orleans, was obtained from the 2000 Census. Blocks were classified into four <br>
categories based on floodwater depth: no flooding (no housing damage), less than 2 feet (minor damage), <br>
2–4 feet (serious damage), and more than 4 feet (severe damage). <br>
We calculated that approximately 25 percent of the pre-Katrina population of New Orleans was not <br>
exposed to flooding and their housing likely suffered little or no floodwater damage, while about 55 <br>
percent of the population experienced more than four feet of flooding, and their housing likely suffered <br>
severe damage. <br>
Estimates of Repopulation Rates <br>
We then estimated repopulation rates for each of the four flood/damage categories for four periods: <br>
three months post-flood (December 2005), six months post-flood (March 2006), one year post-flood <br>
(September 2006), and three years post-flood (September 2008). <br>
A quantitative approach to estimating the repopulation rates was impossible because of the <br>
extremely limited data available on evacuees’ current locations and circumstances and on the number and <br>
characteristics of current residents of New Orleans, and because of the lack of parallel past events that <br>
could be used to derive these rates. We determined that a qualitative approach to estimating the <br>
repopulation rates, based on a consensus process, was the best choice given the constraints we faced—in <br>
particular, given the short amount of time we had to produce estimates. As part of the consensus process, <br>
the authors of this report jointly agreed on a set of repopulation estimates after conducting a review and <br>
discussion of the available evidence and in consultation with various experts. <br>
We gathered and used a wide array of primary and secondary information to develop our <br>
repopulation estimates, including media reports of the circumstances in, and recovery of, New Orleans; <br>
data gathered by local, state, and federal officials; post-Katrina data assembled and analyzed by <br>
organizations such as the Brookings Institution and the Urban Land Institute; telephone interviews with <br>
professionals in areas such as insurance, planning, architecture, building and inspections, real estate, <br>
business development, employment, and demography; and on-the-ground assessments of the recovery in <br>
New Orleans. <br>
The repopulation rates arrived at through the consensus process are based on the flood-<br>
depth/housing-damage category and change by period, reflecting our assumptions that housing <br>
habitability will increase across all flooding and damage categories over time. Although our estimated <br>
- xii - <br>
<hr>
<A name=15></a>repopulation rates in the serious and severe damage categories also rise over time, the rate of increase is <br>
much slower and the repopulation rates substantially lower. <br>
Estimates of the Future Population of New Orleans <br>
Based on the pre-Katrina population and the estimated repopulation rates, the population of New <br>
Orleans in December 2005 was approximately 91,000. This figure is expected to rise rapidly to about <br>
155,000 by March 2006, as basic repairs and stabilization of housing are completed, public services and <br>
infrastructure are restored, and schools and universities reopen. Subsequently, repopulation starts tapering <br>
off: One year after the storm, in September 2006, we estimate a population of about 198,000. Three <br>
years post-Katrina, we estimate that the New Orleans population will reach about 272,000—about 56 <br>
percent of the pre-Katrina population.  <br>
Spatial patterns of repopulation for New Orleans based on our results show that the population <br>
returning to the city in aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is initially concentrated in the high-elevation areas on <br>
either bank of the Mississippi River. Repopulation of other parts of the city proceeds very slowly, and even <br>
by September 2008 the density of population in Lakeview, Gentilly, and New Orleans East neighborhoods <br>
is far below what it was prior to Katrina. <br>
Sensitivity Analyses <br>
We conducted limited sensitivity analyses to examine how changing various assumptions would alter <br>
our population estimates. The most significant finding is that the estimates of the future New Orleans <br>
population for the near term are substantially more sensitive in relative terms—though not in absolute <br>
terms—to our assumptions than are the estimates for the more distant future. The sensitivity analyses also <br>
make it clear that the rate of progress in reconstructing the most severely flood-damaged areas of New <br>
Orleans will set the pace of repopulation of the city and will also determine, to a large extent, the city’s <br>
total population in three years’ time. The sensitivity analyses also point to the considerable uncertainty that <br>
surrounds our estimates of the future population of New Orleans and the entire repopulation process. <br>
CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS <br>
Our conceptual framework and analysis suggest that an important role for policymakers in shaping <br>
the repopulation process in New Orleans is to minimize the uncertainty faced by residents and businesses. <br>
Speeding up the reconstruction process would be an important way to achieve this reduction in uncertainty. <br>
This could be achieved by streamlining the process for obtaining permits to repair or to demolish and <br>
reconstruct housing in the city. Providing clearer and more comprehensive information about progress and <br>
the ultimate goals for restoring the levee system, reconstructing schools, hospitals, libraries, and other <br>
facilities, and the provision of public services such as public transportation and public safety may also <br>
increase the likelihood of former residents and new residents moving to the city. <br>

<hr>
<A name=16></a>As future research, the best way to understand how the repopulation process is unfolding in New <br>
Orleans is to collect better data on evacuees and current residents and to collect such data at regular <br>
intervals. Accurate population estimates from surveys would be perhaps the best gauge of how well the <br>
recovery process in New Orleans is proceeding. Detailed demographic data are also needed to plan <br>
public services, such as schooling and public safety. Nongovernmental and private-sector entities also need <br>
accurate data to assure proper provision of health care, services, and infrastructure.<br>

INTRODUCTION <br>
BACKGROUND <br>
Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Louisiana, on the morning of August 29, 2005. Although <br>
thousands of residents had fled the city in advance of the hurricane, following the mayor’s order for a <br>
mandatory evacuation, many thousands of residents remained behind, either in their own homes or in one <br>
of the available hurricane shelters. The city suffered moderate damage from the hurricane itself, but <br>
substantially more damage from extensive flooding caused by breaks in several levees. In the week <br>
following the hurricane, virtually all the remaining residents were evacuated from the city. New Orleans, <br>
which had an estimated total population of 485,000 in 2000,1 had been reduced to a city of fewer than <br>
several thousand people by the end of the first week of September 2005.2 <br>
In the subsequent weeks, the levee breaches were closed and water was drained from New <br>
Orleans. At the end of September 2005, the city began to allow former residents to return. Initially, only <br>
residents of areas that were not flooded were allowed to return. However, as water was pumped out of the <br>
flooded areas and basic services and infrastructure were restored, residents from more of the affected areas <br>
were allowed to return. Still, the depth of the floodwaters and the duration of flooding meant that most <br>
housing in the flooded areas suffered substantial damage and, for the most part, was not habitable. <br>
One of the key questions facing policymakers is what the repopulation of New Orleans will look like <br>
and at what rate it will occur. Answering that question requires understanding myriad factors. There is the <br>
question of how extensive the damage to housing is. In addition, many evacuated residents quickly settled <br>
in other locations and found new jobs and enrolled their children in local schools. For these families, the <br>
decision to return to New Orleans involves more than just making a commitment to repairing or replacing a <br>
damaged house—it involves assessing the vitality of their former neighborhoods, the availability of schools <br>
and other local services and infrastructure, the rate at which businesses are reopening, and whether their <br>
jobs are likely to return. <br>
1U.S. Census Bureau (2001). The Census Bureau estimated that the population in New Orleans <br>
declined by about 20,000 between 2000 and 2004. <br>
2In this document, we use the terms “City of New Orleans” and “New Orleans” interchangeably. <br>
Note that the incorporated limits of the City of New Orleans correspond precisely with the boundaries of <br>Orleans Parish. The population of the City of New Orleans comprises almost half of the total population of <br>1,338,000 of the New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner Metropolitan Statistical Area. Furthermore, the City of New <br>Orleans was the part of the metropolitan area hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina and flooding in its <br>aftermath. <br>

<hr>
<A name=22></a>OBJECTIVES <br>
The goal of this study is to estimate the future population of New Orleans.3 RAND was asked by city <br>
leaders of New Orleans to develop estimates of the repopulation of the city in the aftermath of Hurricane <br>
Katrina. This work was undertaken specifically to support the efforts of the Bring New Orleans Back <br>
Commission, which was established by New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin. The Commission was faced with <br>
pressing decisions about the city’s plan for recovery from Katrina and needed population estimates to <br>
inform its decisionmaking. In particular, having estimates of the future population of New Orleans in the <br>
immediate future (the next three to six months) and the near-term future (the next one to three years) is <br>
critical to the work of the Commission’s subcommittees on planning, infrastructure, and sustainability and in <br>
guiding the city’s redevelopment process. <br>
Because the time frame for the effort was very constrained—work started in late November 2005 <br>
and concluded in early January 2006—we developed the population estimates in this report as quickly and <br>
as thoroughly as possible. Our report draws on the best available information at the time, and documents <br>
extensively and in detail the methodology and assumptions used. Nevertheless, it was constrained by the <br>
urgent need for results, by limited data availability, and by the considerable uncertainty that surrounded the <br>
entire post-Katrina situation in New Orleans and the region. <br>
More specifically, although we know much about the characteristics of New Orleans residents prior <br>
to Hurricane Katrina, there has been very little systematic data collected on evacuees.4 Thus, we know little <br>
about evacuees’ current locations and circumstances or about their characteristics, information that is <br>
essential for deriving the likelihood of their returning to the city.5 In addition, only limited data are available <br>
on the current population of New Orleans, including newcomers,6 and these data may not be reliable. <br>
Finally, there is little historical precedent on which to base estimates of the return of evacuees following a <br>
3Traditionally, demographers distinguish between population estimates and projections. Population <br>
estimates refer to the current population and population projections apply to future populations. In this <br>report, we use these two terms interchangeably. For a discussion of these terms see Shryock, Siegel, and <br>Larmon (1973). <br>
4The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Postal Service both have assembled <br>
data on evacuees, but these data have not been released. The Gallup Organization conducted a small <br>survey about one month after Hurricane Katrina among a sample of adults who applied to the American <br>Red Cross for aid. For an analysis of the Gallup data, see Elliott and Pais (forthcoming). <br>
5Data from evacuees about their <i>intentions</i> to return to their former homes have been collected in <br>
surveys, but are likely to be of limited use in predicting whether or not someone will move back. This is <br>because people’s attitudes unfold over time and are shaped not just by their intentions but also by <br>competing opportunities, by various constraints, and by family and social dynamics—all of which also <br>change with time. It is thus much more useful to base return probabilities on underlying social, <br>demographic, and economic characteristics. <br>
6The New Orleans Emergency Operations Center has conducted a series of rapid household surveys <br>
of current population of the city. We discuss some of their findings later in this report. <br>

<hr>
<A name=23></a>major, prolonged natural disaster. Together, these caveats mean that considerable uncertainty surrounds <br>
our estimates of the future population of New Orleans. We discuss these caveats throughout the report and <br>
return to them again in the final section. <br>
ORGANIZATION OF THIS DOCUMENT <br>
The report is organized as follows. The overall approach is outlined in Chapter Two, which <br>
considers the various factors shaping the decisions of former residents to return to New Orleans and of new <br>
residents to move to the city from elsewhere and how that informs our future population estimates. In <br>
Chapter Three, we describe the specific methods used to estimate the future population and present our <br>
results for the estimated population of New Orleans three months, six months, one year, and three years <br>
after Hurricane Katrina struck. These periods were chosen to correspond to what we believe will be the <br>
three major stages in the recovery and return process. The first stage (in the first six months following the <br>
storm) corresponds to the immediate recovery, during which individuals whose homes remained habitable <br>
decide to return to the city. The second stage (six months to one year after the storm) corresponds to the <br>
period in which individuals whose homes require minor repairs decide to return. The third stage (between <br>
one and three years after the storm) corresponds to the period in which individuals whose homes were <br>
seriously and severely damaged make the decision to undergo the reconstruction process and return to the <br>
city. We expect that the factors determining migration decisions at each of these stages will differ. The <br>
chapter also includes a discussion of the data and supporting information that shaped the estimates. In the <br>
final chapter, we summarize the results, discuss their implications, and provide an outline of essential <br>
follow-up research that is needed for obtaining more accurate and precise estimates of the future population <br>
of New Orleans. <br>

APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM <br>
In this chapter, we describe our approach to estimating the future population of New Orleans. <br>
Following a discussion of a key definition of population size, we discuss the conceptual framework that <br>
guided our analysis. This framework describes the various factors that are expected to shape the population <br>
of New Orleans and the interrelationships among these factors. The framework, in turn, was used to <br>
motivate our estimation approach. <br>
THE DEFINITION OF POPULATION SIZE <br>
An important definition for this study concerns how people are classified according to their place of <br>
residence. The precise definition of “place of residence” that is chosen will shape the estimates of current <br>
and future population for the City of New Orleans. <br>
The standard definition used by the U.S. Census Bureau is to classify a person as a resident of a <br>
particular place if that is where the person lives and sleeps “most of the time” (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). <br>
A person’s place of residence may not be the same as the person’s legal residence or voting residence. The <br>
Census classifies people who are displaced because of a destroyed or damaged residence caused by a <br>
natural disaster as residing at that location. In other words, a person’s destroyed or damaged residence is <br>
considered by the Census Bureau to be his or her “usual residence.” <br>
In this study, we use an alternative definition of residence. We consider people to be residents of <br>
New Orleans only if they are living and sleeping in the city most of the time. That is, we exclude people <br>
who are displaced from the city because their residences were damaged or destroyed. Like the Census <br>
Bureau, we do not specify precisely what “most of the time” means. However, we do exclude people who <br>
are in the city only during the day or only during the weekend, or those who are visiting the city but who <br>
have a usual place of residence elsewhere (even if they are pre-Katrina residents of the city). <br>
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK <br>
Our conceptual framework merges the two main conceptual approaches that guide research on <br>
human migration, both of which are applicable to this study. The first approach is based largely on <br>
neoclassical economics (Sjaastad, 1962; Lee, 1966), and specifies that an individual (in this case, an <br>
evacuee from New Orleans) chooses to move (in this case, chooses to move back to the city) if the benefits <br>
from the move outweigh the costs. Individuals evaluate the current and future costs and benefits of moving, <br>
which typically differ by individual characteristics, such as age, sex, marital status, number of children, <br>
employment, occupation, and previous migration experience (Greenwood, 1975, 1985; Long 1992). <br>
- 5 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=26></a>The second approach is based on new economics of migration and social network theory (Stark and <br>
Bloom, 1985), and suggests that people do not act on their own in evaluating costs and benefits from a <br>
move. Rather, they act collectively, with their decisions shaped by their family networks, ties with friends, <br>
neighbors, and co-workers, and characteristics of communities. Strong social network ties at a particular <br>
destination increase the likelihood that an individual will move there. Social networks affect migration <br>
decisions by demonstrating the feasibility of a move, providing information and resources that increase the <br>
expected benefits, and reducing the costs and uncertainty associated with a move (Massey, 1990; Stark, <br>
1991; Taylor, 1986). A key insight from the social-network approach for studying migration is that the <br>
benefits from networks may be cumulative. That is, positive experiences may accumulate over time, as <br>
migrants who have had a successful experience share this information with others who are part of their <br>
social networks, which, in turn, further reduces costs and increases benefits from the move. Of course, the <br>
cumulative experience does not have to be positive—it may instead be negative and discourage further <br>
migration. <br>
APPLYING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK <br>
We next apply the conceptual framework to estimating the future population of New Orleans. Our <br>
discussion of the factors shaping the repopulation of New Orleans considers the costs and benefits, as well <br>
as the role of social networks. The decision for evacuees about whether to return to New Orleans is a <br>
migration decision, and it is this decision that will largely determine the future population of the city. <br>
However, the future population of New Orleans will also be shaped by migration to the city of people who <br>
did not reside in the city when Katrina struck, but who moved to the city subsequently. New migrants will be <br>
influenced by a similar, though not identical, set of factors. <br>
Factors Shaping the Decision to Move to New Orleans <br>
The decision of evacuees from New Orleans about whether or not to return to the city depends on <br>
the costs and benefits associated with the move home. The main factors that are likely to shape these costs <br>
and benefits are housing, the provision of basic services and infrastructure, storm protection and flood <br>
control, employment, schools and colleges, and social networks—in particular, the decisions by family, <br>
friends, neighbors, and co-workers about whether to return to the city.7 We discuss each of these factors in <br>
turn. <br>
<i>Housing.</i> In our judgment, housing availability is the factor that most limits the repopulation of New <br>
Orleans. Flood damage to housing was pervasive and widespread in the city, with only a few areas of <br>
7Other factors that may play a role—but are likely to be less salient for most evacuees—include the <br>
availability of services and amenities such as stores, restaurants, and entertainment, and health care <br>providers and hospitals. <br>
- 6 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=27></a>higher ground escaping. There are likely to be substantial differences in housing habitability according to <br>
the depth and duration of flooding and characteristics of the dwelling. For example, raised houses and two-<br>
story houses were likely to face less flood damage, especially if the flood duration was short. <br>
The rehabilitation of damaged housing is a long, slow, and expensive process that involves many <br>
steps, including gutting the dwelling of all flood-damaged material and furnishings, clearing away debris, <br>
remediating any environmental contamination, obtaining an insurance settlement, hiring a contractor and <br>
skilled tradespeople (e.g., electricians, plumbers, roofers) and finding necessary building supplies and <br>
equipment, obtaining flood insurance and loans or grants for reconstruction, and obtaining planning <br>
approval for repairs or demolition and reconstruction. There are likely delays at each step of the process, <br>
because of, for example, a shortage of construction workers (who themselves have no place to live), <br>
understaffing of the planning department, shortages of construction materials, and the huge backlog of <br>
properties needing inspection for insurance settlements. The availability of habitable housing in New <br>
Orleans is likely to be shaped considerably by the city’s willingness and ability to fund adequately and <br>
manage appropriately the building permit and inspection process. The city’s decisions will, in particular, <br>
shape the costs borne by individual homeowners and, ultimately, these costs may affect the repopulation <br>
rate. <br>
Housing is likely to be the main impediment to the rapid return of former residents who want to move <br>
back to the city, because of the scale and scope of the damage to housing throughout New Orleans, the <br>
extensive demolition, repairs, and reconstruction that is required, and the likely slow pace of progress. <br>
Although temporary housing, such as trailers, may provide an interim solution for some people, they are <br>
unlikely to be a panacea for the overall housing problem that New Orleans faces. <br>
A final consequence of the damage to dwellings in New Orleans is that reconstructed housing is <br>
likely to be substantially more expensive than housing of the equivalent size, quality, and location was in <br>
the past. This implies that fewer low-wage and nonworking people will live in New Orleans. <br>
<i>Provision of Basic Services and Infrastructure.</i> Essential basic services include police and fire <br>
protection and emergency medical care; basic infrastructure includes passable roads, piped water and <br>
sanitation, electricity, gas, trash collection, telecommunications, and public transportation. The provision of <br>
these basic services and infrastructure is crucial for allowing most residents to return and to live in the city.8 <br>
Service levels are gradually being restored throughout much of New Orleans, with the exception of some of <br>
the areas hardest hit by flooding.9 Over the longer term, it is not yet clear what level of public services will <br>
8More than 25 percent of the population did not have a car in their household and thus relied on the <br>
bus system for transportation for traveling to work, shopping, or school. As of December 7, 2005, only 10 <br>percent of the New Orleans bus system was back in service (Katz, Fellowes, and Holmes, 2005). <br>
9As of January 3, 2006, three-quarters of customers in New Orleans had access to electric power <br>
and gas in their neighborhoods (City of New Orleans, undated). <br>
- 7 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=28></a>be available in various parts of the city, and proposals have been put forth to limit service provision in <br>
some areas to discourage redevelopment there.10 Uncertainty about services and infrastructure, therefore, <br>
is likely to impact some evacuees’ decisions to return to the city, at least during the immediate and short-<br>
term recovery stages. <br>
<i>Storm Protection and Flood Control.</i> The levee breaches that caused New Orleans to flood have <br>
now been closed, and the levees are expected to be restored initially to provide pre-Katrina levels of <br>
protection for the city. Whether the levees will be upgraded to provide protection against stronger storms <br>
than those for which the current system is designed is currently an open question. However, the high cost of <br>
providing protection against a category-four or -five hurricane—and the considerable time required for <br>
upgrading the levees—means that this is unlikely to happen any time in the near future. <br>
Then again, residents of New Orleans probably understand well that the levees failed to meet their <br>
design specifications and that a commitment to upgrade the levees to meet their <i>original</i> specifications may <br>
be more important than upgrading the levees to protect against stronger storms. Furthermore, there may be <br>
more cost-effective alternatives for improving flood protection for New Orleans. One example is to construct <br>
secondary levees that divide the city, so that a single breach can be contained and does not flood the <br>
entire city. Another example is to close the canals that penetrate deep into the city and that increase its <br>
exposure to levee failures, and shift the pumping stations to where these canals meet Lake Pontchartrain.11 <br>
<i>Employment.</i> The decision of evacuees from New Orleans about whether to return to the city is likely <br>
to be strongly influenced by employment. Employment levels are most likely to rebound for the industries in <br>
which New Orleans has a strong comparative advantage, including tourism, higher education, energy, and <br>
shipping—with employment prospects in the construction industry being particularly bright in the short and <br>
medium term. On the other hand, employment in industries that provide services to the local population are <br>
likely to lag if the rate of return to the city of former residents is slow. Overall, little is known about the <br>
extent of flood damage to local businesses and the effects of this flood damage on businesses reopening <br>
and future employment levels. <br>
Businesses in areas least affected by flooding have started to reopen, but many are currently facing <br>
a shortage of workers, largely because few workers have a place to live in the city. In response, some <br>
employers, such as large hotels, have provided housing to employees. Other workers are commuting to <br>
New Orleans from the suburbs or from cities further away, such as Baton Rouge. In the short term, this <br>
weakens the tie between employment levels and the total population. However, workers appear to be <br>
sharing habitable dwellings at higher rates than in the past (New Orleans Emergency Operations Center, <br>
10Various scenarios are noted by Russell and Donze (2005). <br>11Canals that penetrate the city include the London Avenue Canal and the 17th Street Canal, both of <br>
which failed during Hurricane Katrina. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet also has been blamed for <br>channeling the storm surge into the city. <br>
- 8 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=29></a>2005); at the same time, this means that there is less likelihood that nonworking spouses, seniors, or <br>
children will be living in the home. <br>
In the longer term, the expected higher costs for flood insurance, labor, and reconstruction mean that <br>
employment is likely to decline in two ways. First, there is likely to be a relocation of businesses with a <br>
national or regional market for whom being in New Orleans is not essential. Second, fewer businesses will <br>
be needed to support a smaller population in the city. Even for businesses remaining in the city, <br>
employment is likely to be lower because of higher wage rates. Another effect of the higher costs for <br>
businesses in New Orleans is that these costs will be passed along to consumers; not only will housing be <br>
more expensive, but so, too, will many services and goods for local residents. This will also make it more <br>
difficult for poor and nonworking people to remain in the city. <br>
<i>Schools and Colleges.</i> Very few local schools and colleges were operating in the months after <br>
Katrina struck, but several schools and colleges, such as Tulane University, Xavier University, and Loyola <br>
University, planned to open in January 2006. Most school-aged children who evacuated from New <br>
Orleans enrolled in local schools elsewhere. Many parents apparently plan to keep their children enrolled <br>
in these schools—at least until the end of the current school year—which has reduced the demand for local <br>
schools in New Orleans to reopen quickly.12 <br>
Public schools in New Orleans faced many challenges prior to Katrina, and after the storm, the <br>
public school system was liquidated and reorganized. This is likely to slow the reopening of public <br>
schools.13 Some schools plan to reopen for the new school year in the fall of 2006, which will probably <br>
coincide with the return of many families with school-aged children. Then again, parents who enrolled their <br>
children in schools where they evacuated often found the new schools to have better discipline and <br>
instruction. They may be reluctant to return their children to New Orleans’ troubled schools, which may <br>
affect their likelihood of settling outside the city or remaining in the areas where they evacuated. <br>
<i>Social Networks.</i> The conceptual framework described previously indicates that the decision for <br>
each individual or family about whether to relocate back to New Orleans will not be made independently <br>
on the basis of the costs and benefits that they themselves expect from the move. Rather, decisions are likely <br>
to be strongly shaped by what friends, co-workers, family members, and neighbors decide to do. <br>
Information about positive experiences of individuals and families that return early will be shared with <br>
12Only 4,000 students were expected to be enrolled in New Orleans public schools in January <br>
2006. Public school enrollment prior to the storm was 60,000. Enrollment in the city’s Catholic schools was <br>estimated at 12,000–13,000 in January 2006, compared with a pre-Katrina level of roughly 18,000 <br>(Russell, 2006). <br>
13Of 118 public schools operating prior to Hurricane Katrina, only two New Orleans public schools <br>
(Benjamin Franklin Elementary School and McMain Senior High School) and 15 charter schools were <br>approved for operations in January 2006. Several more schools have been approved to open in August <br>2006 (City of New Orleans, 2006). <br>

<hr>
<A name=30></a>people in their social networks, increasing the likelihood that others will return. Conversely, if early <br>
returnees experience a difficult time and find that few members of their social network have committed to <br>
return to the city, the overall effect will be to reduce the likelihood of others returning and may make it more <br>
likely that the returnees decide to leave the city again, this time for good. <br>
<i>Interdependencies.</i> The process of rebuilding New Orleans is not linear in nature and is not <br>
comprised of independent processes. Rather, there are substantial interactions and interdependencies <br>
among the different factors described previously; furthermore, there is the possibility of negative, deleterious <br>
cycles or positive, virtuous cycles. <br>
As an example of a negative, deleterious cycle, delays or shortfalls in a single area, such as federal <br>
funding for repairing or upgrading the levies, underwriting flood insurance, and subsidizing reconstruction, <br>
could result in delays in businesses reopening, which would lead to fewer workers and their families <br>
returning to the city; this lower rate of return, in turn, may justify still lower levels of federal investment, <br>
which starts a new round of the cycle. The net result would be substantially lower rates of population return <br>
than might otherwise be expected. <br>
As an example of a positive, virtuous cycle, the faster that people move back to the city, the quicker <br>
services and infrastructure, employment, and schools will be restored. This would, in turn, make the city a <br>
more attractive place for displaced residents who would consequently be more likely to return. Thus, <br>
positive feedback effects are also possible. The presence of these interdependencies and feedback effects <br>
makes it important that policy decisions at all levels are made quickly and correctly. <br>
Our Approach to Estimating the Future Population of New Orleans <br>
Based on the conceptual framework outlined previously and available evidence on the various <br>
factors shaping the decision to move to New Orleans, we hypothesized that the availability of housing was <br>
likely to be the most critical constraint shaping the pace of repopulation for New Orleans in the wake of <br>
Hurricane Katrina. In particular, our population estimates are based on the key assumption that the rate of <br>
repair or reconstruction for flood-damaged dwellings will be the major determinant of the future population <br>
of New Orleans. The amount of work required to return damaged dwellings to a habitable state, it was <br>
further assumed, would be principally determined by the amount of flood damage that was sustained and <br>
by the amount of repairs and the time it would take to complete them. <br>
Given this, we assumed that flood damage to housing was directly related to the depth of the <br>
floodwater. Our first step was thus to classify all dwellings in New Orleans according to the depth of the <br>
floodwater and hence the extent of the damage they sustained. Table 2.1 shows the four categories we <br>
used to describe the damage to dwellings. In Chapter Three, we provide more detail on how and why we <br>
derived these four categories. <br>

Based on the distribution of the total population from the 2000 Census across the four <br>
flood/damage categories shown in Table 2.1, we estimated the future population of New Orleans by <br>
applying various repopulation rates to the following periods: three months post-flood (December 2005), six <br>
months post-flood (March 2006), one year post-flood (September 2006), and three years post-flood <br>
(September 2008). <br>
We assumed that the population in areas of flood damage category <i>i </i>at time period <i>t</i>,  <i>it</i><br>
<i>P </i>, is related <br>
to the initial pre-Katrina population,  <i>P </i>, according to the following model: <br>

<i>i</i><br>

where  <i>Rit </i>represents the repopulation rate or the fraction of the base population that lives in areas of flood <br>
damage category <i>i</i> at time <i>t</i>. The selection of the repopulation rates was based on the following principles: <br>First, the rates cannot be negative ( <i>R</i><br>
0<br>
<i>it</i><br>
); second, there is some unspecified upper bound that <i>Rit </i> cannot <br>
exceed; third, the repopulation rate increases monotonically over time ( <i>Rit</i><br>
<i>R</i><br>
); and finally, the change <br>
<i>i</i>(<i>t </i>)<br>

in population rates ( <i>Rit </i>= <i>Rit R</i><br>
) is a parameter of interest that was examined separately and in <br>
<i>i</i>(<i>t </i>)<br>
1<br>
conjunction with the repopulation rates. <br>
The challenge of using this model—or any other similar model—to estimate the repopulation of New <br>
Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is in obtaining reasonable estimates of the repopulation rates, <br>
<i>Rit </i>. The range of possible approaches to estimating the repopulation rates is greatly constrained by the fact <br>
there are extremely limited data available on evacuees’ current location and circumstance and on the <br>
number and characteristics of current residents of New Orleans.14 Furthermore, there are few, if any, <br>
parallel events from the past that could be used to derive these rates. As a consequence, it is difficult or <br>
impossible to use a quantitative approach to estimate the repopulation rates. The alternative in these <br>
circumstances is to use a qualitative approach. We discuss the qualitative approach we took, along with all <br>
the key assumptions underlying it, in Chapter Three, when we present the results of that approach. <br>
14In analyzing the demographic effects of other natural disasters—such as Hurricane Andrew, which <br>
struck Florida in 1992—researchers have fielded new population surveys, after concluding that virtually all <br>other data sources have significant shortcomings (Smith, 1996; Smith and McCarty, 1996). <br>

ESTIMATES OF THE FUTURE POPULATION OF NEW ORLEANS <br>
The culmination of the approach presented in Chapter Two is an equation that yields estimates of the <br>
future population of New Orleans for four points in time based on estimates of housing habitability. Those <br>
estimates are the product of the two terms in Equation 1: (a) an estimate of the pre-Katrina population by <br>
the condition of its housing <i>after</i> Katrina, organized into the four damage categories; and (b) an estimate of <br>
future repopulation rates for the four damage categories at the four points in time. <br>
In this chapter, we present our results for the estimates of the future population of New Orleans, <br>
preceded by our results for the two terms of the equation that yield those estimates. We also explain how <br>
we arrived at those results. Finally, we present the results of some limited sensitivity analyses.  <br>
PRE-KATRINA POPULATION ESTIMATES ORGANIZED BY POST-KATRINA HOUSING HABITABILITY <br>
The Approach <br>
Housing in New Orleans suffered two kinds of assault from Hurricane Katrina: wind damage and <br>
flood damage. Given the extensive flooding, most housing damage was caused by flooding of brackish <br>
water that poured through broken levees or surged over them (Bachman, 2005). Accordingly, we assumed <br>
that the habitability of a housing unit was determined first by the amount of flood damage it received, and <br>
second by the likely pace of repair and rebuilding. <br>
As discussed briefly in Chapter Two, we divided New Orleans into four categories of flood damage. <br>
Here, we discuss those categories in more detail: <br>
1.  <i>No Damage:</i> Housing in this category largely suffered from wind damage, such as leaking <br>
roofs, broken windows, and fallen trees. We assumed that most of these structures could <br>
feasibly be stabilized (e.g., with blue tarps) or repaired and lived in almost immediately. <br>
Such dwellings were clustered along the natural levee of the Mississippi in the Garden <br>
District, French Quarter, and in Algiers. These areas also were among the first to have water <br>
and power restored and among the first to see local businesses and services reopen—<br>
making these neighborhoods the most attractive for early repopulation.15 <br>
2.  <i>Minor Damage:</i> Housing located in areas with less than 2 feet of flooding was considered <br>
to have minor damage. If the house was elevated on some form of foundation or slab and <br>
remained above the peak flood stage, it might not have suffered from any flood damage at <br>
15This hypothesis is supported by the findings of the New Orleans Emergency Operations Center <br>
(2005). <br>
- 13 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=34></a>all. If flooding did occur, we assumed that the owner would have to hire craftspeople to do <br>
discrete repair work and to get the work inspected and approved by the city. Reestablishing <br>
an electric power hookup might also require an inspection. According to our calculations, <br>
about 63,000 households out of a total of 188,000 households (34 percent) were subject to <br>
flood levels of less than 2 feet or were not in areas that flooded at all.16 <br>
3.  <i>Serious Damage:</i> Housing units in locations with 2–4 feet of standing water were <br>
considered to have suffered serious damage. We assumed that on the ground floor the <br>
brackish water would have irreparably damaged floors and the lower portion of interior <br>
walls; electrical, heating, and central air conditioning systems; large appliances; and <br>
furniture. Walls with insulation would have to be opened up and dried out over a period of <br>
time. We assumed that structures in this category suffered damage equal to 51 percent or <br>
more of their value.17 According to National Flood Insurance Program guidelines (the so-<br>
called “50-Percent Rule”), upon repair, such structures must be raised above the FEMA Base <br>
Flood Elevation for that location. Accordingly, we assumed that the owner would have to <br>
hire a contractor to manage repair and reconstruction work and the owner would have to <br>
obtain building permits and get the work inspected and approved by the city. According to <br>
our calculations, about 31,500 households (almost 15 percent of the total) were subject to <br>
serious flooding. <br>
4.  <i>Severe Damage:</i> Houses in locations with more than 4 feet of flooding were assumed to <br>
have severe structural and integrity damage.18 In the worst case, this classification includes <br>
structures that were moved off their foundations. We assumed that the owner would have to <br>
hire a contractor to manage partial or complete demolition and reconstruction or rebuilding <br>
16Of 215,091 housing units, a total of 26,840 (12 percent) were vacant. Housing vacancy rates <br>
were higher in blocks with no damage (16 percent, or 9,695 vacant households out of a total of 62,413 <br>households), minor damage (15 percent, or 1,194 out of 12,448), and serious damage (15 percent, or <br>4,601 out of 31,499). In contrast, vacancy rates were under 10 percent (10,630 vacant households out of <br>a total of 108,731 households) in areas with severe damage. <br>
17This hypothesis is consistent with the large number of structures inspected and found to have <br>
partial structural damage (i.e., yellow-tagged) by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Shaw Group (final <br>inspections data cited by the Emergency Operations Center, 2005). <br>
18According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, flooding of more than three feet typically <br>
produces severe structural or integrity damage (Pace, 1988). However, there is disagreement on this point <br>by some local engineers and architects, who report that historical evidence and current core samples <br>indicate no structural damage to wood soaked by water for prolonged periods (discussion at forum on <br>“Building Solutions: Hurricanes Hugo and Katrina,” 2005; panelists included Richard Gruber, Director, <br>Ogden Museum; David Houston, Chief Curator, Ogden Museum; Errol Barron, Barron and Toups <br>Architects, New Orleans; Reed Kroloff, Dean, Tulane University School of Architecture; and Ray Huff, <br>Huff+Gooden Architects, LLC, South Carolina). <br>

<hr>
<A name=35></a>and that the owner would have to obtain permits and have the work inspected and <br>
approved by the city. We also assumed that structures in this category, if repaired, would <br>
have to be raised above the base flood elevation. Given the intensity and extent of damage <br>
in severely flooded neighborhoods, we assumed that they would be the last to undergo <br>
initial clearing of debris and restoration of basic services and infrastructure, which is <br>
necessary to begin any assessment, planning and design, or construction efforts. Areas in <br>
the severe damage category include Lakeview, Gentilly, and the Lower Ninth Ward. <br>
According to our calculations, about 108,000 households (50 percent of the total) were <br>
affected by severe flooding. <br>
Estimates of the effects of flooding on the housing stock in New Orleans vary greatly. For example, <br>
only 5,529 structures (about 4.3 percent) inspected by the Army Corps of Engineers and Shaw Group have <br>
been red-tagged (i.e., deemed unsafe to enter and occupy).19 Many of these houses were probably <br>
structurally unsound before the storm (Russell, 2005). The city has asserted that a red tag does not <br>
necessarily mean that demolition is required (City of New Orleans, undated). Structural engineers and <br>
building professionals have noted that homes suffering serious and even severe damage could be <br>
rehabilitated after removing the interior contents and finishes (such as wallboard) and drying out the <br>
structure. Older homes, which typically have higher-quality wood and lack insulation, and which constitute <br>
a large portion of the housing stock, are likely to be easier to salvage (Avegno, 2005; Barter, 2005; <br>
Shalett, 2005). And, given the large number of culturally and architecturally significant structures in the city, <br>
it is expected that special efforts will be made to restore them. <br>
More pessimistic scenarios about the plight of housing have also been put forth. Some have noted <br>
that newer housing, such as in New Orleans East and Parkview, was typically one story (thus, more of the <br>
building was potentially flooded) and constructed of lower-quality materials, which may require razing due <br>
to cost considerations (Manning, 2005; Eskew, 2005). Because of the presence of widespread and <br>
persistent poverty among New Orleans residents, many housing units were likely in poor condition. Low <br>
property values and a weak rental market also may make such properties more likely candidates for <br>
demolition than rehabilitation.20 Environmental hazards caused by mold and polluted floodwaters may add <br>
cost, complexity, time, and uncertainty to the recovery and rebuilding process and it may deter some <br>
residents from returning (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Environmental Protection <br>
Agency, 2005; Tanneeru, 2005). Some city officials have reportedly estimated that out of 188,000 <br>
19Final inspections data cited by New Orleans Emergency Operations Center (2005). <br>20The median rent in many of the flooded areas was under $315 per month (GCR and Associates, <br>
Inc., 2005). <br>

habited housing units in New Orleans, 50,000 (27 percent) may have to be razed (Marsh and McLennan <br>
Companies, 2005). <br>
To implement this four-level classification scheme, we obtained detailed block-level information for <br>
the entire city of New Orleans on the number of housing units and total population corresponding to each <br>
of the four categories of flood-depth and housing damage. <br>
Information on the depth of the floodwater was derived from remote sensing data on the extent of <br>
flooding in New Orleans on September 10, 2005—a day of near-maximum flooding.21 The floodwater <br>
depth was calculated using a geographic information system that included detailed topographic information <br>
for the city.22 We obtained these data at the block, tract, and neighborhood levels.23 Figure 3.1 shows the <br>
mean depth of floodwater, by category, for all blocks in New Orleans. Flooding was most severe in the  <br>

boundaries are established by the City of New Orleans. <br>
- 16 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=37></a>low-lying areas near Lake Pontchartrain and in the mid-city area, while neighborhoods situated on the <br>
natural levees on both sides of the Mississippi River had no flooding. Blocks along several natural ridges <br>
that cross the city and areas along the shore of Lake Pontchartrain also escaped major flooding. <br>
We used block-level data to calculate the number of housing units and population in each of the four <br>
damage categories. The City of New Orleans is divided into a total of 10,181 census blocks. For each of <br>
these areas, we obtained data on the following: <br>
 <br>
•<br>
Total population <br>
•<br>
Housing (total housing units; the number of vacant units, and housing units by tenancy that <br>
distinguishes owner-occupied and renter-occupied units) <br>
•<br>
Flooding (classified by depth of floodwater to the nearest foot). <br>
 <br>
We used this information to calculate, for all blocks in the city, the total number of housing units and <br>
population in each of the four flood-depth/housing-damage categories. <br>
The Results <br>
Table 3.1 presents our results, which show that approximately one-quarter of the pre-Katrina <br>
population of New Orleans was not exposed to flooding based on their block of residence and that their <br>
housing likely suffered little or no floodwater damage.24 Then again, about 55 percent of the population <br>
experienced more than an average of 4 feet of flooding in their neighborhoods, and their housing most <br>
probably suffered severe damage. <br>

ESTIMATES OF REPOPULATION RATES <br>
The Approach <br>
As noted in Chapter Two, given the study time constraints and the lack of available data, we were <br>
unable to calculate repopulation rates quantitatively. Thus, we opted for a qualitative approach. Qualitative <br>
approaches to estimating future trends have been widely used in situations where there are no historical <br>
data, complete and accurate information on the current circumstances are missing, and the entire situation <br>
is outside the range of past experience. More formal and elaborate qualitative approaches include the <br>
Delphi method (see, for example, Linstone and Turoff, 1977), developed by RAND researchers in the <br>
1950s as a technique for drawing on the knowledge of a group of experts with a range of backgrounds to <br>
arrive at a consensus. A simpler technique is a consensus approach, in which a group of knowledgeable <br>
- 18 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=39></a>individuals, through a review and discussion of the available evidence and consultation with various <br>
experts, jointly agree upon a set of estimates.25 We adopted the latter approach for this study, using a <br>
consensus panel comprising of the four authors of this report to obtain estimates of the repopulation rates. <br>
We concluded that this was the best choice given the constraints we faced. <br>
The consensus approach has several strengths, as well as certain weaknesses. The main strength of <br>
the consensus approach is that it is quick and straightforward to apply and the method is easy to <br>
understand. Hence, it is easy to replicate in other settings and with other panel members. Moreover, the <br>
consensus approach is likely to provide reasonable estimates in circumstances in which quantitative <br>
techniques cannot be applied, such as those facing New Orleans—in particular, it is unlikely to produce <br>
extreme estimates that lack immediate “face” validity. <br>
The weaknesses of the consensus approach are that it appears ad hoc and may be biased by <br>
myriad factors. Biases may arise from reliance on readily available information, groupthink or the spiral of <br>
silence,26 political pressure to meet certain targets, or selective perceptions. In applying the consensus <br>
approach to estimating repopulation rates, we worked to mitigate the disadvantages of this technique by <br>
documenting as completely and comprehensively as possible all of the information that we assembled and <br>
reviewed on the extent of flooding, the damage to housing caused by the flooding, and the prospects for <br>
housing reconstruction and by identifying our main underlying assumptions. Nevertheless, another team of <br>
experts given the same information may have arrived at different results. This type of replication would be <br>
valuable because the results could be used to generate error bounds for the estimates that reflect uncertainty <br>
in deriving the model parameters that are otherwise obscured by the deterministic, rather than stochastic, <br>
nature of our single set of estimates of the future population of New Orleans. <br>
Here, we lay out in detail the assumptions underlying the estimates of repopulation rates. We <br>
gathered and used a wide array of primary and secondary information to characterize the population <br>
situation in New Orleans and to develop our population projections. This background information included <br>
the following: <br>
 <br>
•<br>
Local and national media reports on housing, employment, and related developments <br>
concerning the recovery of New Orleans <br>
•<br>
Data gathered by local, state, and federal officials, such as the Louisiana State Department <br>
of Labor and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) <br>
25Consensus methods have been used extensively in government and planning, business and <br>
industry, and in medicine and public health (e.g., see Fink et al., 1984). <br>
26Groupthink occurs when the consensus-forming process leads people to reinforce each other’s <br>
views and not consider all alternatives, while the “spiral of silence” occurs when those with dissenting views <br>are increasingly unwilling to express their views. <br>

 <br>
Based on these data, we determined that key issues driving those assumptions were insurance and <br>
financing, construction and rebuilding, and willingness and ability to return. We discuss each below. <br>
<i>Insurance and Financing.</i> Insurance is likely to be a critical factor driving the pace of rebuilding <br>
and repopulation of New Orleans. We assume that housing in the areas not flooded or that experienced <br>
minor flooding will be repaired using payments by insurance companies for insured losses (e.g., under <br>
wind and flood policies) or owners’ existing credit and cash reserves. In areas characterized by serious or <br>
severe damage, we assume that housing repairs and rebuilding will be funded by insurance payments, <br>
federal assistance available for raising structures above the base flood elevation,27 borrowing, and cash <br>
reserves. Nevertheless, we believe that recovery and rebuilding in areas suffering serious and severe <br>
flooding could be slowed or impeded by several factors. <br>
On average, about half of all losses from natural disasters are uninsured (Seeman, 2005). This <br>
proportion appears to hold in the case of New Orleans. According to one early estimate, of an estimated <br>
$170 billion in losses, $100 billion are uninsured (Kline, 2005). Roughly 80 percent of homes in New <br>
Orleans were located in a FEMA-designated flood zone at the time Katrina hit, but, according to FEMA, <br>
only 40 percent of housing units in New Orleans were covered by flood insurance. In other words, a <br>
significant share of housing units that received serious or severe flood damage were unlikely to have flood-<br>
insurance coverage. The maximum federal flood policy coverage in effect at the time of Katrina was <br>
$200,000 for the structure and $60,000 for contents. The average policy coverage ($152,000) was <br>
roughly equal to the median home price at the time of the storm. This means that even if a house were <br>
insured, the average flood policy may not be sufficient to repair serious or severe damage, as well as the <br>
loss of contents. Moreover, flood insurance does not cover the loss of the use of a home. Many evacuees <br>
have received housing allowances by FEMA, but these are due to expire by early 2006. Thus, many <br>
27The National Flood Insurance program offers policy holders Increased Cost of Compliance <br>
assistance of up to $30,000 to raise a structure above the base flood elevation. This money may also be <br>used to demolish a structure (Shalett, 2005). <br>

<hr>
<A name=41></a>displaced families have had to draw down their savings that they might have dedicated to rebuilding to <br>
obtain temporary shelter and to replace lost personal belongings.28 <br>
Looking forward, it is not clear that private insurers will be ready to write wind-damage policies for <br>
dwellings being rebuilt in New Orleans—at least in the short term.29 According to Marsh Risk Consulting, a <br>
risk analysis and advisory firm, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita “revealed vulnerabilities and failures in the <br>
catastrophe models that insurers and reinsurers use to analyze their exposures to loss” (Marsh and <br>
McLennan Companies, 2005, p. 1). Property-insurance providers have been severely affected by <br>
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and Marsh concluded that “[t]here are strong indications that insurers will be <br>
more discriminating in their choice of policyholders and that they will be increasing rates” (Marsh and <br>
McLennan Companies, 2005, p. 1). Revised risk models are expected in early 2006 (Muir-Wood, 2005). <br>
It is conceivable that evolving risk models will lead to increases in the cost of insurance and greater caution <br>
by insurers. Efforts by regulators to put caps on insurance rates may motivate some insurers to exit the <br>
market.30 <br>
According to flood-insurance program regulations, all residential structures that are located in a <br>
flood zone and have mortgages issued by federally regulated lenders must be insured. The flood maps <br>
developed by FEMA for parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain are 5–25 years old and were in the <br>
process of being updated prior to Katrina. It is likely that significant changes will now be made that would <br>
expand the area designated as a flood zone, as well as increase the base flood elevations (the height to <br>
which severely damaged building must be raised and new structures must be built). FEMA has noted that <br>
“the strength and extent of Hurricane Katrina’s wind field resulted in a storm surge greater than historical <br>
maximums” (FEMA, 2005a), creating the need to develop new maps. FEMA has reported that its flood <br>
maps of the area are in some stage of restudy. This has yet to occur in Louisiana, but the agency notes that <br>
“[a]dditional analyses may be needed as a result of Katrina, because the hurricane affected some areas in <br>
significant ways. If so, the scheduled release [of new flood maps] will be delayed in order to incorporate <br>
the new data” (FEMA, 2005b, p. 2). As of mid-December 2005, FEMA had not yet issued its advisory <br>
base flood elevations. This means that property owners, city planners, insurers, and other interested parties <br>
lack critical guidance on codes and standards that building must meet.31 Recommendations have been <br>
made that the city adopt stricter building codes that include a freeboard provision that calls for elevating <br>
28In testimony to Congress, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco asserted that without significant <br>
federal assistance, homeowners “will have not money to rebuild” (“State Officials Defend Katrina <br>Response,” 2005) <br>
29The federal government offers flood insurance—but not insurance from damage from wind or other <br>
factors—and is obligated to provide such insurance to qualifying households. <br>
30This scenario occurred in California following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. <br>31FEMA issued Advisory Base Flood Elevations in mid-November for coastal Mississippi. <br>
- 21 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=42></a>structures an additional increment above the FEMA base flood elevation. This would mitigate uncertainties <br>
in flood studies and earn a reduction in flood insurance rates.32 <br>
Many property owners will choose not to build and lenders and insurers are unlikely to back <br>
rebuilding efforts unless adequate flood protection can be provided. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has <br>
stated that category-three storm protection will be in place by June 2006, the start of the next hurricane <br>
season. The federal government has not made a commitment to provide category-five storm protection and <br>
does not appear to be in a position to make such a commitment in the near future. <br>
<i>Construction and Rebuilding.</i> A recent survey of U.S. architecture firms by the American Institute of <br>
Architects indicated that the rebuilding period after a natural disaster typically lasts 2–5 years. An <br>
important determinant of the pace of rebuilding (both of existing housing and new housing) is the <br>
availability of labor and materials. <br>
Katrina destroyed an estimated 275,000–300,000 individual housing units in the Gulf region and <br>
probably damaged an equivalent number. A large number of commercial and government structures were <br>
also damaged or destroyed (Baker, undated). The large-scale rebuilding required is likely to place <br>
significant upward pressure on the cost of construction materials—in a market environment where the cost <br>
of some building materials had already seen “significant price increases” as a result of a regional <br>
construction boom and rising world market prices for key materials such as steel and concrete.33 For <br>
example, Economy.com noted a 2.5-percent increase in the price of concrete and a 5.5-percent increase in <br>
the price of wallboard and other gypsum products in the two-month period after Katrina struck. From early <br>
2005 to the end of 2008, Economy.com forecasts a producer price escalation of 5.8 percent for lumber <br>
and wood products, a 12.9-percent increase for gypsum products and cement, and a rise of more than 7 <br>
percent for plumbing fixtures and heating equipment as a consequence of post-hurricane rebuilding. <br>
Economy.com also indicated that local shortages of some building supplies may appear.34 Energy price <br>
hikes after hurricanes Katrina and Rita have added to price escalation and disruptions in supplies of <br>
building materials (Stundza, 2005). As a consequence, the cost of housing construction per square foot <br>
may rise dramatically in the immediate post-hurricane period. Escalation in construction costs will create a <br>
disincentive for property owners to rebuild or it may encourage them to delay rebuilding in the hopes that <br>
construction costs will fall at some time in the future (Nossiter, 2005; Shalett, 2005). Furthermore, insurance <br>
payments and savings may not be sufficient to cover the increased costs of construction. <br>
32The State of Louisiana also is expected to implement new, stricter building codes (American <br>
Planning Association, 2005.) <br>
33Economy.com research (cited by Baker, undated); Andrews (undated). <br>34Economy.com (cited by Baker, undated). Economy.com predicted that escalation in the prices for <br>
building materials may ease if the nationwide boom in home building cools off. <br>
- 22 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=43></a>In contrast to much of the rest of the South and the Gulf Coast, metropolitan New Orleans in recent <br>
years has had a relatively slow housing construction market. On average over the past decade, only about <br>
8,000 new housing units were produced per year (Ragas, 2005). Therefore, the area will have to expand <br>
significantly its capacity for planning and inspections, its number of construction firms, its labor, and its <br>
building-supply networks. By all local accounts, in the months immediately after the storm, the ability of <br>
residential and commercial property owners to find qualified construction contractors and craftspeople—for <br>
demolition and to perform triage and repairs—has been extremely difficult. For example, if a property <br>
owner did not have a preexisting project or relationship with a contractor, he or she likely would to have to <br>
wait in line until the first wave of projects was completed—a six-month proposition (Gist, 2005; Barter, <br>
2005). Moreover, because New Orleans was flooded with brackish water, all electrical systems and <br>
mechanical systems that were flooded will have to be replaced. This will require electricians to perform the <br>
work, as well as qualified inspectors to examine and approve the work after it is completed. Individuals in <br>
New Orleans report a shortage of building and electrical inspectors as a result of layoffs by the city and the <br>
electrical utility, Entergy New Orleans, because of their financial distress.35 Reconstruction will take even <br>
longer than normal and cost more as workers themselves have limited living quarters.36 <br>
Based on this evidence, we assumed that most repairs to housing that was not flooded could be <br>
returned to habitability almost immediately. For houses suffering minor damage, we estimated the repair <br>
time to be six months to one year. For seriously or severely damaged homes <i>that are intended to be </i><br>
<i>repaired</i>, we add an assessment and decisionmaking period of six months to one year, and estimate <br>
construction to last up to three years. For structures that are razed and new structures that are built, we <br>
estimate that the assessment, financing, planning and design, and construction period might last as long as <br>
5–10 years.37 To this point, the American Institute of Architects concluded that of the estimated 250,000 <br>
units lost in Louisiana, only about 100,000 units would be replaced by 2008 (Baker, undated). <br>
<i>Willingness and Ability to Return.</i> We considered other factors that may affect individuals’ <br>
willingness and ability to return and reoccupy housing and to assume or resume employment. Although we <br>
assumed that 100 percent of the housing stock in areas not subjected to flooding was habitable by mid-<br>
November 2005 (as shown below), we did not assume that all previously occupied housing units will be <br>
reoccupied. Based on telephone interviews and media reports, we see several scenarios whereby people <br>
35By the end of November, only 64 percent of Orleans Parish had restored electricity and 50 <br>
percent had gas service (Katz, Fellowes, and Mabanta, 2006). New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin stated on <br>December 3, 2005, that full power would not be resuming until January 2006 (Tanneeru, 2005). <br>
36Holtz-Eakin (2005). While New Orleans and the state and federal governments resolve critical <br>
issues, such as what level of flood protection they will be able to provide, other communities in the region <br>are moving forward with building, attracting labor and resources to those areas first. <br>
37The American Institute of Architects estimates that an average assessment and construction period <br>
for a generic rebuilding project is six months to three years. <br>
- 23 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=44></a>with habitable homes choose not to return to them. Such scenarios include individuals with medical <br>
conditions and seniors who choose to stay away because of a perceived cutbacks in services, such as <br>
healthcare and public safety;38 unemployed individuals who have found employment or more favorable <br>
living conditions outside the parish;39 lack of adequate schools;40 and impoverished individuals who were <br>
evacuated to distant locations and who may find it difficult to return.41 The 2000 Census indicates that <br>
nearly half of the housing units in New Orleans were rental units; relative to homeowners and those with <br>
mortgages, we expect that these people are substantially less likely to return to their original residences if <br>
the units were damaged or if they evacuated to another location. <br>
Looking further into the future, other factors likely will affect individuals’ willingness to return or move <br>
to New Orleans. These factors include evacuees’ age and economic status; evacuees’ distance of <br>
relocation from New Orleans; the availability and quality of schooling; and measures to protect the city <br>
from future natural disasters. Employment prospects in New Orleans are likely to play an important role in <br>
shaping people’s willingness and ability to live in the city. Rebuilding the area’s economy will depend not <br>
only on the available labor supply but also on repairs to the region’s infrastructure, the availability of <br>
private and public investment, and a host of other factors. A recent survey by Economy.com suggests that <br>
economic recovery in the Gulf region will proceed more slowly in Louisiana than in any of the other states <br>
affected by Hurricane Katrina. Indeed, Economy.com suggests that economic recovery in the state will not <br>
occur until 2008—three years after the storm (Baker, undated). Because the New Orleans metropolitan <br>
region and the city in particular were damaged even more heavily than the state as a whole, we expect <br>
that employment recovery in the city will also lag. Research indicates that the service and trade sectors are <br>
the most vulnerable to disaster impacts (Kroll et al., 1990), and are the slowest and least likely to make a <br>
long-term recovery (Webb, Tierney, and Dahlhamer, 2002). These vulnerable sectors are the primary <br>
38Medical services are greatly restricted throughout New Orleans post-Katrina: Only two of the eight <br>
hospitals in the city were open in late November and they were at reduced capacity (Thomas, 2005). Less <br>than one third of the city’s restaurants had reopened by November 2005 (Katz, Fellowes, and Mabanta, <br>2006). <br>
39The Housing Authority of New Orleans, which managed 20,000 public housing and Section 8 <br>
housing units, had not reopened its housing because of security and safety concerns as of the end of 2005. <br>Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) statistics indicate that two-thirds of the Katrina evacuees from all areas (and <br>50 percent of black evacuees) that had not returned to their homes in October were already employed <br>(Bernstein, 2005). <br>
40Only one of the 116 public schools in New Orleans was open by December (Katz, Fellowes, and <br>
Holmes, 2005). Orleans Parish public schools were not planning to reopen any East Bank campuses until at <br>least summer 2006 (Moran, 2005). <br>
41Poorer people tended to be evacuated to more distant locations in the wake of Katrina (Tizon and <br>
Smith, 2005). A BLS survey released February 3, 2006, found that more than 26 percent of Katrina <br>evacuees who had yet not returned home were classified as unemployed compared with a national <br>unemployment rate of 4.7 percent (El Nasser and Overberg, 2006). <br>
- 24 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=45></a>sources of employment in the New Orleans metropolitan area (U.S. Department of Labor, undated). Ed <br>
Durabb, the Jefferson Parish planning director, suggests that many people, especially those on public <br>
assistance, will be able to find better economic and educational opportunities in their new locations and <br>
will, thus, have little incentive to return to New Orleans (Moran, 2005). <br>
One longer-term concern faced by residents and businesspeople, lenders, and insurers is the <br>
feasibility and timeline of repair and improvement to the city’s levee system. While Mayor Nagin has <br>
indicated that the levees will be rebuilt to withstand a category-three hurricane by the 2006 hurricane <br>
season, adequately strengthening the levees and addressing other future flood prevention remedies will take <br>
several years at a minimum (Bohannon and Enserink, 2005). This, combined with the other concerns, such <br>
as decisions about where redevelopment can proceed, and the performance of the public school system <br>
and public safety, will likely slow the return of evacuees and influx of new immigrants. Disaster research, for <br>
example, has indicated that parents are reluctant to expose children to threatening circumstances, even <br>
when they do not feel threatened themselves (Kirschenbaum, 1996). Deep uncertainties about these issues <br>
and the complexity of modeling decisions based on these factors make long-term population projections <br>
exceedingly difficult (Warner, 2005). <br>
The Results <br>
Based on these assumptions, Table 3.2 presents the repopulation rates at which we arrived through <br>
the consensus process. The rates differ by flood-depth/housing-damage category and generally change by <br>
period. A summary of the assumptions underlying the rates shown in the table is included in the final <br>
column. To illustrate how the information in Table 3.2 summarizes our results, consider the first row in the <br>
table. This row shows we estimated that the repopulation rate for areas with no flooding in December <br>
2005, three months after Hurricane Katrina struck, would be about 65 percent of the base population of <br>
full-time residents.42 This estimate is based on the following evidence: (1) The houses in this area suffered <br>
wind damage but no flood damage and, with minor repairs, could be occupied by early returnees; (2) <br>
utilities were reconnected quickly for most households; (3) vacant houses in these areas were not occupied <br>
immediately; and (4) no families with children returned during this early period. The subsequent rows show <br>
that we estimated repopulation rates of about 20 percent in areas with moderate housing damage (less <br>
than 2 feet of flooding), 5 percent in areas with serious damage (2–4 feet of flooding), and 1 percent in <br>
areas with severe damage (more than 4 feet of flooding). <br>
The repopulation rates shown in Table 3.2 for subsequent periods (three months, one year, and three <br>
years after the storm) reflect our assumptions that housing habitability will increase across all flooding and <br>
42This figure is consistent with the results of unpublished rapid surveys conducted on November 12–<br>
13, 2005, and December 3–4, 2005 (EOC, 2005). <br>

<hr>
<A name=46></a>damage categories. We believe it is possible that the population in census blocks that did not experience <br>
flooding will be higher in 2006 than in 2000 because vacancy rates will decline and the average size of <br>
households in those areas will increase as more people crowd into the limited supply of available and safe <br>
housing.43 Over the longer term, housing redevelopment is likely to be concentrated in these areas too—<br>
already, there is evidence that property prices have risen rapidly in these “high and dry” areas of New <br>
Orleans (Rivlin, 2006). Accordingly, we assume that, after one year, the repopulation rates in nonflooded <br>
areas could rise to more than 100 percent of pre-Katrina levels. In areas that suffered minor damage, we <br>
assume that repopulation rates rise to 75 percent one year after Katrina and to 100 percent after two more <br>
years. Although our estimated repopulation rates in the serious and severe damage categories also rise <br>
over time, the rate of increase is much slower and the repopulation rates substantially lower: We expect <br>
repopulation rates of 45 percent in the serious-damage category and of 30 percent in the severe-damage <br>
category after three years.44 Myriad factors are likely to be responsible for this expected trend: limited or <br>
lack of savings among homeowners; property abandonment and mortgage foreclosures; lack of adequate <br>
insurance coverage; regulations and codes that raise the cost of repairs and construction; escalation in <br>
construction costs; uncertainty about the level of flood protection; and resistance by insurers and lenders to <br>
service perceived high-risk areas. <br>
It is important to note that the estimates of repopulation rates reflect not only the habitability of <br>
dwellings, but also other factors. For example, the average household in New Orleans contained about 2.6 <br>
persons prior to Katrina. Anecdotal evidence suggests that friends and family members are currently sharing <br>
scarce housing: The EOC (2005), based on a limited survey, estimated that habited housing units on the <br>
West Bank had about 3.2 individuals on the weekends in early December 2005. Our estimates also <br>
assume gradual repopulation by people living in temporary travel trailers provided by FEMA, but they do <br>
not include persons living in hotels or cruise ships.45 <br>
43For instance, according to our calculations, 11,600 housing units in areas with less than 2 feet of <br>
flooding were listed as vacant prior to the storm. On the West Bank, 13 percent of housing units were <br>vacant at the time of the 2000 Census. A significant share of vacant properties likely will be occupied post-<br>Katrina. <br>
44The occupancy of severely damaged dwellings is projected to have begun within three months of <br>
Katrina, not because houses will have been reconstructed in that short time, but because some residents are <br>stabilizing their homes and “rouging it” (e.g., by not using the ground floor). Other residents have qualified <br>for and obtained the temporary housing trailers provided by FEMA, and some are pursuing a mix of these <br>strategies (Rigamer, 2005). The performance of government efforts to provide trailer housing will affect the <br>March 2006 and one-year population estimates. <br>
45About 18,000 FEMA trailers were expected to be delivered to New Orleans by early 2006 <br>
(Russell, 2006). The cruise ship and hotel populations were estimated at 18,000 and 4,500 respectively on <br>December 3, 2005 (EOC, 2005). <br>

<A name=48></a>ESTIMATES OF THE FUTURE POPULATION OF NEW ORLEANS <br>
The previous two chapters have provided estimates for the two terms to the right of Equation 1 <br>
shown in Chapter Two. Here, we provide the results for the product of those two terms. Specifically, in <br>
Table 3.2, we present our estimates of the future population of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane <br>
Katrina. We estimate that the population of New Orleans in December 2005 was approximately 91,000. <br>
This figure is expected to rise rapidly to about 155,000 by March 2006, as basic repairs and stabilization <br>
of housing is completed, public services and infrastructure are restored, and schools and universities <br>
reopen. Subsequently, repopulation starts tapering off: One year after the storm, in September 2006, we <br>
estimate a population of about 198,000. Three years post-Katrina, we estimate that the New Orleans <br>
population will reach about 272,000—about 56 percent of the pre-Katrina population. Although we <br>
recognize that there are hopes in the New Orleans community that the population will bounce back faster <br>
than we project, we believe that because so many New Orleanians lived in areas that experienced serious <br>
or severe flood damage, the challenges of rebuilding place a strong damper on the population recovery <br>
potential.  <br>
In Figure 3.3, we show the spatial patterns of repopulation for New Orleans based on our results. <br>
These maps—which present the population density in December 2005, March 2006, September 2006, <br>
and September 2008—show that the population returning to the city in aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is <br>
initially concentrated in the high-elevation areas on either bank of the Mississippi River. Repopulation of <br>
other parts of the city proceeds very slowly; even by September 2008, the density of population in <br>
Lakeview, Gentilly, and New Orleans East neighborhoods is far below what it was prior to Katrina. Note <br>
that these maps assume that population will be spatially distributed in the post-Katrina period in direct <br>
proportion to the spatial distribution prior to Katrina. However, this is unlikely to occur, particularly in areas <br>
with housing severely damaged by the flooding, where it is far more likely that only certain areas will be <br>
redeveloped while the remaining residential areas will be converted to other land uses. <br>
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF FUTURE POPULATION ESTIMATES OF NEW ORLEANS <br>
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the extent to which our population estimates for New <br>
Orleans are shaped by several major assumptions that underlie our approach. Although the sensitivity <br>
analysis shows how population estimates would be altered as a result of making specific changes in the <br>
assumptions underlying our method, it does not provide confidence intervals or upper or lower bounds to <br>
our baseline estimates. <br>
We varied two sets of assumptions for the sensitivity analysis. First, we considered the effects of <br>
damage to housing at each floodwater depth category being more severe and less severe than in our <br>
baseline estimates presented previously. Specifically, we examined the effects of moving the flood damage  <br>

for housing at each floodwater depth, by increasing and decreasing the repopulation rates by five <br>
percentage points and by ten percentage points. <br>
A summary of the results from the sensitivity analysis is presented in Table 3.3. Several main findings <br>
emerged from this analysis. The most significant finding is that the estimates of the future New Orleans <br>
population for the near term are more sensitive in relative terms to our assumptions than are the estimates <br>
for the more distant future. The sensitivity analysis suggests that moderate changes in our assumptions could <br>
lead to a December 2005 population estimate as low as 30,467 (65 percent lower than the baseline <br>
population estimate of 90,744) or as high as 139,212 (53 percent higher than the baseline estimate). <br>
However, our population estimates for New Orleans for September 2008 are much less influenced by our <br>
assumptions. The estimates of total population three years after Hurricane Katrina ranges from a low of <br>
223,403 (18 percent below the baseline population estimate of 271,870) to a high of 320,338 (18 <br>
percent above the baseline estimate). <br>

the four damage categories. The graphs show that the population of areas with no flood damage stabilizes <br>
rapidly. The population of areas with minor and serious damage is small enough that changing the <br>
parameters does not have a major effect on the results. However, the large population in areas with severe <br>

a large extent the city’s total population in the three years’ time. <br>

CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS <br>
CONCLUSIONS <br>
In this report, we presented an analysis of the repopulation of New Orleans in the wake of the <br>
tremendous devastation brought about by levee breaches and flooding from Hurricane Katrina. In <br>
particular, we drew on expert opinion, news reports, and various extant data sources to estimate the New <br>
Orleans population in December 2005 (roughly three months after Hurricane Katrina struck), in March <br>
2006 (six months after Katrina), and in September 2006 and 2008 (respectively, one and three years after <br>
the hurricane and floods). We estimated that the population of New Orleans will be about 155,000 in <br>
March 2006 and will grow to 198,000 in September 2006 and to 272,000 in September 2008. <br>
Our results are subject to a considerable number of qualifications and caveats. First, these estimates <br>
are based on limited data on circumstances in New Orleans, considerable uncertainties about the <br>
rebuilding process and the level of government and private investment and support, and limited historical <br>
experience with a natural disaster of this magnitude. Second, very limited primary data have been collected <br>
in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, either on evacuees from the city or on current city residents (including <br>
new migrants to the city) or on commuters who work in the city but live elsewhere. Not knowing the current <br>
status and circumstances of evacuees and residents introduces additional uncertainty into our population <br>
estimates. Third, the analysis had to draw on a significant number of assumptions. These assumptions, <br>
which have been documented extensively in this report, are subject to error and are often not based on <br>
hard data or confirmed experience, since there are few historical parallels on which to draw. Finally, our <br>
results included a limited sensitivity analysis to examine how our estimates change as a number of key <br>
assumptions are altered. <br>
Despite these qualifications and caveats, our results provide some important insights into the current <br>
and future population of New Orleans. In particular, the results suggest that the rebuilding process in the <br>
most severely devastated areas of the city—which together accounted for 55 percent of the pre-Katrina <br>
population of the city—will largely determine the future population of New Orleans in the medium term and <br>
beyond. This is because areas that suffered no damage or only minor damage will in all likelihood be <br>
rapidly resettled, and there is only a small population in areas that suffered serious damage. The difference <br>
between high and low estimates from our sensitivity analysis was driven primarily by the situation in the <br>
severely flooded areas. <br>
An important point about our estimates of the future population of New Orleans is that they are <br>
based on an equilibrium process—a process in which the number of people moving back to the city <br>
matches the housing reconstruction process and the return of jobs, schools, services, and infrastructure. In <br>
other words, they are mid-range estimates and, in particular, do not reflect either the upper bound for <br>
- 33 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=54></a>housing and population that might be achieved, or the lower bound. The equilibrium process could be <br>
altered for the better if additional outside resources were made available for reconstruction. This would lead <br>
to the supply of housing being expanded, which would keep housing costs down and encourage people to <br>
return. Then again, uncertainties about the future of the city could lead to people delaying their return to the <br>
city, which might, in turn, dramatically slow down the repopulation of the city. <br>
This suggests an important role for policymakers shaping the repopulation process in New Orleans. <br>
In particular, there are factors they can influence or even control that could increase the likelihood of <br>
positive feedback effects. Among the factors likely to have the greatest impact on the repopulation rate are <br>
policies and procedures to streamline the process for obtaining permits to repair or demolish and <br>
reconstruct housing in the city. Policies that reduce uncertainty for residents and business are also likely to <br>
have a positive effect on the repopulation process. For example, there is considerable uncertainty about <br>
planned repairs and upgrades to the levee system, the plans for reconstructing schools, hospitals, libraries, <br>
and other facilities, and the provision of public services, such as public transportation and public safety. <br>
Providing clearer and more comprehensive information about progress and the ultimate goals for restoring <br>
these systems and services may increase the likelihood of former residents and new residents moving to the <br>
city. <br>
NEXT STEPS <br>
The best way to understand how the repopulation process is unfolding in New Orleans is to collect <br>
better data on evacuees and current residents and to collect such data at regular intervals. Accurate <br>
population estimates from surveys would be perhaps the best gauge of how well the recovery process in <br>
New Orleans is proceeding. Detailed demographic data is also needed to plan public services, such as <br>
schooling and public safety. Nongovernmental and private-sector entities also need accurate data to assure <br>
proper provision of health care, services, and infrastructure. <br>
Of foremost importance is collecting detailed individual-level data on the current residents of New <br>
Orleans and on the evacuated residents of the city. These data will be of tremendous value in <br>
understanding the circumstances of the current and former residents of New Orleans and in assessing their <br>
likelihood of returning to the city. These data will also be useful for undertaking more detailed analyses that <br>
consider, for example, the return rates to New Orleans of different populations. It is of considerable interest <br>
to many to know how return rates to the city will vary according to race, socioeconomic status, family <br>
structure, number of children, and other key demographic factors. <br>
New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina was a poor city that was highly segregated by race and <br>
socioeconomic status (Brookings Institution, 2005). As the hurricane approached, poor residents—who <br>
were predominately African American—had more difficulty evacuating the city due to low rates of car <br>
ownership (Berube and Raphael, 2005). The stratification of the city became highly visible to the country as <br>
images were broadcast of most poor and mostly African-American residents stranded on their rooftops and <br>
- 34 - <br>
<hr>
<A name=55></a>in the Superdome. Lack of transportation will also make it difficult for poor evacuees to travel back to the <br>
city to evaluate the condition of their former residences and either to begin the process of repairing their <br>
homes or to find a new place to live. Furthermore, many poor residents were tenants who, on average, <br>
paid extremely low rents. In the aftermath of Katrina, these people may no longer be able to afford the <br>
higher rents that are likely to be demanded for reconstructed dwellings in New Orleans. Finally, poor <br>
residents continue to have poor employment prospects. For these reasons, there are likely to be major <br>
demographic and socioeconomic disparities in the repopulation of New Orleans. Understanding the <br>
differences in repopulation rates by race and socioeconomic status is an important topic for future research. <br>
Future work should also analyze the business sector and its redevelopment as a critical factor <br>
affecting the demand for labor and employment prospects for residents of New Orleans that, in turn, will <br>
shape the future population of the city. For example, a rigorous analysis of future demand could be based <br>
on the situation of, and prospects for, firms that are exporters—including first the tourism-related sector that <br>
provides goods and services to residents outside the city. These export businesses will be among the most <br>
significant drivers of the overall economic regrowth and labor demand. Other work should focus on past <br>
and present commuting patterns and the likelihood that labor demand in the city is met by hiring workers <br>
who live outside the city of New Orleans.  <br>
Finally, future work should focus on developing improved assumptions to guide the population <br>
projections. Some assumptions could no doubt be quantified better. And, of course, as time passes, we will <br>
have better insights into just how many people are returning to the city and into how employment is <br>
increasing and the reconstruction process is unfolding.<br>
