<A name=4></a>Executive Summary<br>
W hen Hurricane Katrina tore through New Orleans in August 2005, <br>
the levee failures inundated the city—particularly its most vulnerable <br>neighborhoods—with a hazardous sea of fuel, sewage, and chemicals. <br>
Floodwaters containing pathogens from raw sewage and toxic contaminants from <br>oil spills, pesticides, and hazardous waste poured into neighborhood streets, leaving <br>behind thick sediment inside homes, in parks, and on lawns. Two years after the <br>storm, a team of researchers from NRDC, working in partnership with local <br>community groups, has found that hazardous levels of arsenic are still present in <br>the soil at several locations in New Orleans—including schools, playgrounds, and <br>residential areas.<br>
Testing of sediment in flooded areas of New Orleans in the months following Katrina by the United States <br>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and NRDC identified high concentrations of arsenic, lead, and other <br>contaminants in many areas of the city in significant excess of state and federal clean-up guidelines. Two years later, <br>we have discovered that people are returning home to communities that have still not been adequately cleaned up. <br>Soil sampling done by NRDC in March 2007 revealed that nearly 25 percent of the 35 New Orleans playgrounds <br>and schoolyards tested two years after Katrina may be classified as arsenic “hot spots.” Our data show six schools, two <br>playgrounds, and four residential areas sitting on arsenic “hot spots,” where levels of the toxic substance exceed EPA and <br>Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) clean-up guidelines (see Table 1). <br>

<A name=5></a>Our testing has further shown that arsenic was not a problem in most locations prior to Katrina. NRDC’s testing of <br>archived, location-matched samples from 63 residential areas around the city showed that arsenic concentrations were <br>low before the flooding, indicating that the floodwaters created a new arsenic problem. This finding is important because <br>EPA and LDEQ have dismissed the high arsenic levels as probably present before the flooding, thus not triggering a legal <br>authority for them to clean up the contamination now. We now know that the high arsenic levels are a new issue in many <br>areas of New Orleans, not an old problem.<br>
Arsenic may come from prior use of arsenic-based pesticides, trash incineration, leakage from industrial sites and the use <br>of building materials pressure-treated with chromium-copper arsenate. Alternatively, the arsenic may have been in the <br>sediment at the bottom of the canals and Lake Pontchartrain and distributed throughout the city with the floodwaters. <br>Regardless of where the arsenic came from, the flooding spread it on the surface of the ground, where people can easily <br>touch it, breathe it, or get it in their eyes and mouths. Children’s tendency to put their hands in their mouths and play <br>on the ground make them particularly vulnerable to contaminants in soil where they live, learn, and play. <br>

            Arsenic is toxic to humans and is known to cause cancer; no amount is considered fully safe. Many scientific <br>studies, including numerous reviews by the National Academy of Sciences, have determined that arsenic can cause <br>cancer of the bladder, skin and lungs; likely causes other cancers; and can cause a variety of other serious health <br>problems, including birth defects, cardiovascular disease, skin abnormalities, anemia, and neurological disorders.<br>
<b>Other Health Concerns in the Aftermath of the Storm<br></b>In addition to toxic sediment, residents returning to the region have been exposed to other health threats:<br>
<b>•   Mold</b>, the product of heat, water, and natural organisms growing on walls and elsewhere, poses serious risks to air <br>
quality. When inhaled, mold spores can cause major allergy and asthma attacks, cough, hypersensitivity pneumonitis <br>(a pneumonia-like illness), and even infections in people with weakened immune systems.<br>
<b>•   Fine particulate matter</b>—small particles of soot, dust, or dried-up sediment <br>
that penetrate deep into the lungs—has been linked to reduced lung function, <br>
<i>&quot;After Hurricane Katrina, it is </i><br>
coughing, wheezing, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, lung cancer, and premature <br>
<i>just as important to test and clean </i><br>

<A name=6></a><b>Residents Still Wading in Debris and Waste<br></b>Hurricane Katrina left behind another, more visible reminder of the storm: an enormous quantity of debris, much of <br>which has still not been cleaned up. The forces of Katrina and Rita combined to dump as much as 100 million cubic <br>yards of debris into the region—enough garbage to fill the Superdome more than 55 times—much of it mixed with <br>hazardous materials.2 Although the Army Corps of Engineers, supervised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency <br>(FEMA), has been largely responsible for cleaning up this debris, efforts have been slow and uncoordinated, and a great <br>deal of debris remains in neighborhoods. It is critical that debris cleanup proceed with an eye toward a sustainable New <br>Orleans. Measures must be taken to preserve the unique historical and social flavor of the city without creating new <br>problems that will only add to the legacy of toxic pollution in the region.<br>
<b>Solutions for Charting a Safer Course for New Orleans<br>Our government must make New Orleans safe for returning residents and kids. </b>We recommend a three-step plan  <br>for safely cleaning up schools, playgrounds, and communities in New Orleans. The EPA and LDEQ should protect <br>residents by:<br>
1.  <b>Fully informing the public</b> of health risks, including access to treatment and information on exposure to toxins;<br>
2. <b>  Conducting additional sampling </b>at schools, playgrounds, and other “hot spots” where EPA and NRDC testing <br>
has shown high levels of arsenic or other contaminants in the soil, to determine the full scope of the contamination. <br>Sampling should also be done at other locations around the city to make sure that other hot spots have not been <br>missed, with particular attention to locations where there are sensitive populations, such as schools and playgrounds.<br>
3.   <b>Performing a site-specific assessment </b>after sampling to determine whether the contamination poses a health risk, <br>
especially to sensitive populations such as children.<br>
4.   <b>Working with local communities</b> to clean up all areas that have unsafe levels of contamination. Clean-up measures <br>
include removing the first 6 inches of topsoil, safely disposing of the contaminated soil, and then replacing it with <br>6 inches of fresh topsoil. The cost of doing this is relatively low. For an average-size single-family home, the cost <br>of completing the remediation, including soil hazardous material disposal fees and equipment rental, is between <br>$3,500-$5,000. <br>
 <br>The city can also take steps to remove the mountains of debris left behind by the storm. Some strategies for effective <br>debris management include:<br>
<b>• </b>  Practicing deconstruction, not demolition, by dismantling structures in a way that separates its  <br>
component materials.<br>
•   Recycling, reusing, and composting. <br>
•   Emphasizing proper waste disposal by banning open burning, avoiding the construction of unnecessary new <br>
landfills, and using the proper procedures for removing hazardous debris.<br>
•   Establishing an effective process for debris management that includes plans for short- and long-term  <br>
debris disposal.<br>
Finally, the federal government has a role to play in helping New Orleans rebound from the storms. The 110th Congress <br>can aid cleanup efforts by:<br>

<b>  Environmental Justice After the Storm </b><br>
 <br>
The images seared into our collective national memory from the days following Katrina are those of displaced <br>
victims waiting, often for days, to be rescued from the deadly storms that had engulfed New Orleans. The grim reality <br>is that, more often than not, these victims were low income and people of color. Low-income communities and <br>communities of color often bear the brunt of environmental health disasters; nowhere was this more evident than in <br>post-Katrina New Orleans.<br> <br>
Before the storm, low-income communities and communities of color in New Orleans were already dealing <br>
with more than their fair share of environmental burdens: A quarter of inner-city New Orleans children had enough <br>lead in their blood to be classified as lead-poisoned, and at risk for learning disabilities and behavioral problems.3 <br> <br>
Two years after the storm, not only are pollution problems in these neighborhoods exacerbated, but public <br>
services such as schools, day care centers, hospitals, and public utilities continue to function at lower levels than before <br>the storm. Public housing is scarce, and other housing is more expensive than it once was. Some 114,000 people still <br>live in temporary trailers. Many of the neighborhoods that remain virtually uninhabitable were once predominantly <br>communities of color.<br> <br>
In those neighborhoods that are coming back, environmental agencies are using the fact that some New <br>
Orleans communities had poor environmental quality before the storm as an excuse not to clean up to levels that <br>would adequately protect public health now. They say Katrina can’t be blamed for the problem. But the reality is that <br>even if the storm didn’t discriminate, decisions not to address health threats that remain in low-income communities <br>and communities of color do discriminate. Environmental justice requires that policy decisions, funding choices, and <br>revitalization efforts include the voices of all New Orleans residents.<br>
<b>NRDC in Action: Responding to Katrina</b><br>
 <br>
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, NRDC responded to the crisis by immediately sending to New Orleans <br>
a team of experts on public health and environmental protection. NRDC’s field studies were among the first  <br>conducted in the city after the storm hit. We partnered with local groups to measure toxins, test for health hazards,  <br>and make sure that government support reached the city’s neediest neighborhoods. We distributed information on <br>proper cleanup techniques and helped residents to make sense of the EPA’s inscrutable data on environmental hazards. <br> <br>
Two years after the storm, our work in New Orleans continues: NRDC scientists continue to take soil samples <br>
that expose dangerous chemicals in schoolyards, our policy experts are pushing the government to respond to  <br>residents’ contamination concerns, and our advocates are working with local groups to make sure clean-ups take place. <br>

Hazards on the Playgrounds: <br>NRDC Finds Elevated Levels <br>of Arsenic in New Orleans <br>Schoolyards <br>
NRDC sampling two years after Hurricane Katrina shows that arsenic levels <br>
at some New Orleans schools and playgrounds today exceed LDEQ and <br>EPA clean-up guidelines. Arsenic is a substance that can cause cancer, <br>
neurological damage and other chronic health problems, and is particularly harmful  <br>to children.4<br>
In March 2007, NRDC researchers returned to New Orleans to test for ongoing evidence of arsenic in areas of concern <br>such as schools, playgrounds, and residential areas where previous sampling conducted by EPA in 2005 and 2006 found <br>high levels of arsenic. The team tested at 116 residential, elementary school, and playground sites in the city. The arsenic <br>levels in these soil samples varied significantly. This is not surprising, as the contaminated sediment likely washed into <br>low areas, against structures, or down storm drains, creating a patchy residue of contamination. Although only four <br>of the 81 residential sites (5 percent) exceeded the government clean-up level in this most recent round of testing two <br>years post-Katrina, some of these sites had very high levels. For example, a soil sample from a residential neighborhood <br>in Mid-City contained a whopping 41 mg/kg of arsenic, and residential areas in New Orleans East contained arsenic <br>concentrations of 23.6 and 30 mg/kg (see Table 2). These levels are two to three times higher than the government <br>clean-up levels for arsenic. Remaining residential arsenic “hot spots” were identified in Mid-City, New Orleans East, and <br>Lakeview. However, many other hot spots may be unidentified, since the scope of the sampling was limited.<br>

<hr>
<A name=9></a><b>Some Schoolyards and Playgrounds Are Arsenic “Hot Spots”<br></b>Schools and playgrounds showed some of the highest arsenic levels among the sites tested. Soil tested in playgrounds <br>and schools in March 2007 shows that almost 25 percent of the 35 playgrounds and schoolyards tested may be arsenic <br>“hot spots.” Thirty percent of samples taken from schools and 13 percent of samples taken from playgrounds exceed the <br>Louisiana and EPA clean-up level (see Table 3).<br>

<A name=10></a><b>Arsenic Contamination of Soils in New Orleans is a New Problem Since Katrina<br></b>In addition to studying current day levels of arsenic in New Orleans soils, NRDC also conducted additional testing <br>to determine if New Orleans soils were high in arsenic before the flooding caused by Katrina.  Archived soil samples <br>collected by researchers at Xavier University in residential neighborhoods in the years before Katrina hit were tested <br>for arsenic and the results were compared to the results of EPA testing at the same (or nearby) locations conducted <br>immediately after the flooding. The levels of arsenic in the soil were consistently higher in the samples taken after the <br>storm (see Figure 1). Out of 63 residential locations with elevated arsenic levels according to EPA tests in 2005-2006, <br>only four sites had elevated arsenic pre-Katrina. The post-flood “hot spots” contained arsenic concentrations averaging <br>24 mg/kg, whereas pre-Katrina soil samples from matched locations averaged 4 mg/kg (see Table 4). In comparison, the <br>LDEQ clean-up guideline is 12 mg/kg. <br>

However, NRDC’s analysis of archived soil samples demonstrates <br>that the arsenic discovered post-Katrina was generally not present before the storm. Responding to pressure from NRDC <br>and community groups, on August 21, 2007, LDEQ performed sampling at four of the top six schools NRDC identified <br>with high levels of arsenic.

Health Threats to New Orleans <br>Residents: Pollution in the Air, <br>Land, and Water<br>
Years of environmental abuse in New Orleans did more than simply expose the <br>
region and its residents to the deadly winds and floodwaters of Hurricanes <br>Katrina and Rita. Long-term neglect also made it possible for floodwaters <br>
to distribute a variety of health and safety hazards throughout the area. Floodwaters <br>containing pathogens from raw sewage and toxic contaminants from oil spills, <br>pesticides, and hazardous waste poured into neighborhood streets, leaving behind <br>sediment inside homes, in parks and other public spaces, and on lawns. As the waters <br>receded, mold grew abundantly in flooded buildings, contaminating both the indoor <br>and the outdoor air with dangerously high levels of mold spores. The drying sediment <br>blew in the air, creating another respiratory hazard for returning residents. Finally, <br>contaminated drinking water from leaking sewer and water mains was an ongoing <br>threat for many months. <br>
In the years since Katrina and Rita, a number of organizations and agencies have tested the air, water, and soil in the <br>areas affected by the storms. Among those collecting data were government agencies such as the U.S. Environmental <br>Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); a team of scientists dispatched <br>by the Natural Resources Defense Council, joined by the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, Louisiana <br>Environmental Action Network, Holy Cross Neighborhood Association, and other local groups; and a team of testers <br>
Natural Resources Defense Council  I <b>12   </b><br>
<hr>
<A name=13></a>working for the Louisiana-based Subra Co. and Altamont Environmental, Inc. The results of these tests were remarkably <br>consistent, showing a clear set of environmental concerns in the region. <br>
<i><b>History of Toxin-Laden Sediment</b></i><br>
The floodwaters that inundated New Orleans carried a mixture of soil, sewage, and industrial contaminants.5 When <br>
they receded, they left behind a layer of sediment up to 4 inches thick. Although some of the sediment has washed into <br>storm drains, much of it has likely settled into the soil or accumulated along the sides of buildings. When activities <br>disturb the sediment, these toxins can become airborne and inhaled by workers and residents. As families move back into <br>these communities, children may be playing on contaminated soil for years to come. <br>
The toxins spread throughout New Orleans likely came from multiple sources, including:<br>
• storm-related releases and spills of petroleum, pesticides, and other chemicals;<br>• toxic sediment from lake and river bottoms stirred up by the storm;<br>• flooding of hazardous waste sites;<br>• household hazardous wastes, such as cleaning agents and home pesticides; and<br>• abandoned automobiles.<br>
Testing by NRDC, the Subra Co., and the Environmental Protection Agency found sediment contaminated with lead, <br>petroleum, pesticides, industrial chemicals, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Health effects from <br>long-term exposure to arsenic and the various toxins in sediment after the flooding include an increased risk of cancer, as <br>well as neurological damage and other chronic health problems.6 <br>
The testing that has received the broadest attention was that done by the EPA. By and large, the EPA has reassured the <br>public that the communities are safe. But NRDC’s careful analysis of the EPA’s data called into question the agency’s <br>assurances.<br>
Specifically, NRDC analysis showed that most districts in New Orleans contained—and in some cases, still contain—<br>concentrations of arsenic, lead, diesel fuel, or cancer-causing benzo(a)pyrene above levels that would normally trigger <br>investigation and possible soil cleanup in the state of Louisiana. Some hot spots in residential neighborhoods had levels <br>of contamination that are more than 100 times normal soil-cleanup levels. For example, at a location in Mid-City, the <br>amount of arsenic in the soil following the storm was 200 times the federal health-based level of concern for soil in <br>residential neighborhoods, and 6.5 times the Louisiana cleanup level for residential soil. Locations in Chalmette and in <br>the St. Roch neighborhood had diesel fuel contamination more than 200 times the Louisiana soil-cleanup level. A hot <br>spot for benzo(a)pyrene contamination was in Bywater, at the Agricultural Street Landfill, where the levels exceeded <br>Louisiana soil-cleanup levels by a factor of more than 50. <br>
Independent tests by NRDC and others also revealed that sediment contamination by certain substances, such as arsenic <br>and diesel fuel, was widespread in a number of neighborhoods (Mid-City, Lakeview, New Orleans East, Uptown/<br>Carrollton, the Garden District, Bywater, the Ninth Ward, and Gentilly). In all of these areas, arsenic and diesel fuel <br>contaminants were found at levels that exceed the soil-cleanup guidelines for residential neighborhoods issued by the <br>Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and the EPA.  <br>
Such sediment contamination poses a health hazard in both the short term and the long term. In the short term, <br>residents and workers may be exposed to toxic materials by getting harmful particles on their hands or in their eyes and <br>mouths, or by inhaling dust from airborne sediment at a cleanup site or elsewhere. Such exposures can cause coughing; <br>irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat; and skin rashes. In the long term, families living in once-flooded neighborhoods <br>may be at significant health risk from exposure to contaminated soil, unless the sediment is safely removed and replaced <br>with clean soil.<br>
Natural Resources Defense Council  I <b>13   </b><br>
<hr>
<A name=14></a>NRDC analysis of EPA data collected in 2005-2006 turned up disturbing results about the level of contamination of <br>four dangerous toxins in the greater New Orleans area:<br>
<b>•   Arsenic</b>—Ninety-five percent of the sediment samples collected by the EPA had levels of arsenic that could <br>
potentially pose a significant cancer risk, according to EPA guidelines. Thirty percent of samples could trigger <br>cleanup under the weaker Louisiana guidelines. Arsenic is toxic to humans and is known to cause cancer; no amount <br>is considered fully safe.7 <br>
<b>•   Diesel fuel</b>—The levels of diesel fuel (measured as diesel-range organics) in 59 percent of the sediment samples <br>
collected by the EPA would potentially trigger soil cleanup under LDEQ guidelines. In Orleans Parish, this number <br>reached 91 percent. Inhalation of the vapors released from diesel fuel can damage the kidneys, increase blood <br>pressure, and decrease the ability of blood to clot.8<br>
<b>•   Benzo(a)pyrene</b>—Levels of the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene were high enough in 43 percent of the sediment samples <br>
collected by the EPA to potentially trigger soil cleanup under LDEQ guidelines. Benzo(a)pyrene is one of several <br>dangerous PAHs that can cause chromosome damage, cancer, and immune suppression and pose risks to normal fetal <br>development.9<br>
<b>•   Lead</b>—Lead, which is known to affect brain development in children and believed to cause kidney problems10 <br>
and reproductive disorders11 in adults, was found at levels that could pose a serious health risk. Five percent of the <br>sediment samples the EPA collected in the greater New Orleans area had levels of lead that would potentially trigger <br>soil cleanup under LDEQ guidelines. However, in Orleans Parish, as much as 28 percent of samples taken had <br>enough lead to be classifiable as hazardous waste according to EPA guidelines. <br>
<i><b>Mold<br></b></i>The combination of late-summer heat and floodwaters created the perfect mold-growing environment, and NRDC's <br>testing in the months after the flooding revealed extremely high levels of mold spores in the air. Mold exposure can <br>cause congestion, sneezing, runny or itchy nose, and throat irritation. More serious symptoms include major allergy and <br>asthma attacks, cough, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (a pneumonia like illness with symptoms including difficulty <br>breathing and fevers). Some studies have shown that outdoor levels of mold spores are directly associated with childhood <br>asthma attacks requiring a visit to an emergency room, and that these respiratory effects are present even where daily <br>airborne spore counts are relatively low.12 Mold also poses a special threat to immunosuppressed individuals.13<br>
Children in New Orleans may be especially vulnerable to mold because of the city’s very high asthma rate. One study <br>indicated that “if a child lives long term in New Orleans, the chance is approximately 24 percent that the child will <br>develop asthma over his or her early lifetime.”14 The combination of mold and asthma can prove deadly. According to <br>one study, “the risk of death from asthma is 2.16 times higher if mold spore counts are greater than 1,000 spores per <br>cubic meter.” 15 In post-hurricane New Orleans, NRDC tests found that outdoor spore counts per cubic meter soared to <br>more than 50,000 in some neighborhoods. <br>
Using standards established by the National Allergy Bureau, outdoor mold spore counts in most flooded neighborhoods, <br>including New Orleans East, the Lower Ninth Ward, Bywater, Gentilly, Chalmette, Uptown/Carrollton, and Mid-City, <br>were classified as “Very High,” with estimated average daily levels of more than 50,000 spores per cubic meter. Levels <br>in Lakeview were deemed “High.” Such outdoor mold spore concentrations could easily trigger allergic or asthmatic <br>reactions in sensitive people.<br>
NRDC’s testing of homes for indoor mold found that where moldy furniture, carpets, and drywall were still in place, <br>mold readings were extremely high—so high, in fact, that these homes would be considered dangerous and uninhabitable <br>by any definition. NRDC also tested homes that had been flooded and had then undergone some remediation, including <br>

<hr>
<A name=15></a>removal of contaminated furniture and carpets and removal of some drywall. In these homes, mold concentrations were <br>lower, but still dangerously high. Tests of two homes that had been fully remediated, including removal of all furniture, <br>carpets, and drywall down to the studs, as well as airing and mold treatment, found mold spore counts that very nearly <br>matched the outdoor air.<br>
Subsequent testing by other researchers has confirmed the high levels of airborne mold, and has also demonstrated <br>endotoxin in the indoor air of flooded homes post-Katrina.16 Endotoxin is a product of certain types of bacteria, and is a <br>very potent cause of inflammatory reactions, especially of the respiratory system. There is a need for ongoing monitoring <br>of the mold situation in residential neighborhoods of New Orleans. Unfortunately, the EPA and other agencies have <br>failed to undertake ongoing monitoring, so New Orleans residents today have no way of knowing how high the mold <br>counts are in their air. <br>
<i><b>Particulate Matter<br></b></i>Fine particulate matter—that is, very small particles of dust, soot, or sediment—has been linked in hundreds of studies <br>to a long list of serious human health effects, including reduced lung function, coughing, wheezing, missed school and <br>work days due to respiratory symptoms, increased use of asthma medications, cardiac arrhythmias, strokes, emergency <br>room visits, hospital admissions, lung cancer, and premature death. Infants and children are especially sensitive to <br>particulate matter pollution, as are people with asthma, the elderly, and people with preexisting heart or lung disease. <br>
Particulate matter is a problem in many American cities, largely the result of cars, trucks, construction vehicles, and <br>industrial facilities that burn fossil fuels. New Orleans faces a very specific challenge because floodwaters covered much of <br>the city with sediment that carries a range of toxic substances. After the floodwaters receded, the sediment dried, and it <br>was then kicked up into the air by wind or even by attempts to clean it. Once airborne, it easily could be inhaled. <br>
NRDC samples of airborne particulate matter revealed high levels of lead, arsenic, and chromium. The concentrations <br>of arsenic and chromium were far above EPA guideline values for air, and the concentration of lead was above EPA’s air <br>quality standard. Compared with monitored concentrations of lead from prior years in New Orleans, the concentrations <br>were far higher in the aftermath of Katrina (October 2005). Separate testing in St. Bernard Parish conducted by the <br>Louisiana Bucket Brigade found “arsenic, cadmium, and various benzene compounds…at levels that exceed EPA and <br>the [Louisiana] Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) standards.”17 It is unlikely that the EPA standards for <br>regular particulate matter were sufficient to protect against the unusual composition of the particles in the air in the New <br>Orleans area. Unfortunately, there were no government warnings about disturbing or inhaling the sediment, and ongoing <br>testing of the air quality has not been done to ascertain that the problem has resolved. <br>
<i><b>Damaged Drinking Water Systems<br></b></i>Another health challenge confronting the Gulf Coast is the provision of clean water to residents.18 Louisiana estimated <br>that it needed to rebuild 50 percent of affected sewage treatment plants at a cost of $38 billion.19 <br>
When water mains rupture, the pressure in nearby sections of the water system decreases significantly. The low water <br>pressure can cause contaminants from outside the pipes to be sucked into the system. Contaminated soil, effluent from <br>adjacent broken sewer mains, or petroleum spills can be pulled into the drinking water system through breaks in the <br>pipes. As a result, even if the water leaving the treatment plant is safe to drink, it may become contaminated on the way <br>to the tap.<br>
In June 2006 the New Orleans water system was still losing 85 million gallons of water daily—more than two-thirds of <br>the total leaving the city’s treatment stations. By September 2006 the volume of water leaking out of the system was still <br>estimated at 40 million to 50 million gallons per day.<br>

<A name=16></a>In response to community concerns about potential contamination of the drinking water, NRDC lead a coalition of <br>nonprofit, nongovernmental groups, that tested water in New Orleans on three separate occasions in June through <br>October 2006. The testing focused on residual chlorine, bacterial contaminants, byproducts of disinfection, and <br>parasites; five samples were also tested for a list of 170 chemical contaminants. <br>
Sampling showed that the quality of the drinking water in most homes <br>was fairly good. Testing for bacteria, molds, and yeasts did show that the <br>

The samples that tested high for HPC were located in Uptown/Carrollton and <br>

in Village de l’Est. Retesting at these three sites revealed lower HPC (4, 100, <br>and 740 at the three sites). The persistently elevated HPC was in a FEMA <br>trailer in Village de l’Est. <br>
None of the initial 30 tests were positive for total coliform, but one of the three retests was positive for total coliform. <br>Total coliform is an indicator of certain types of bacteria in water. However, because coliform may be from a fecal or <br>non-fecal source, the presence of total coliform alone is not a decisive indicator of the health risk of drinking water. <br>However, one of the sites had elevated coliform bacteria on repeat testing. Coliform bacteria can be associated with <br>intestinal illness, and are a potential cause for concern.<br>
Although the results of the independent water tests do not demonstrate widespread contamination or clear health threats, <br>the sampling was too limited to conclude that the water is safe at all times and in all locations in New Orleans. Many <br>residents reported sporadic problems with low water pressure and unusual smell, color, or taste, so it is fairly likely that <br>there are still remaining problems with the water system. More systematic testing throughout the system is necessary in <br>order to assure residents that their water is safe to drink.<br>
<b>What Oil Spills and Toxic Chemical Pollution Mean for New Orleans Neighborhoods <br></b>According to the U.S. Coast Guard and the EPA, some 575 Katrina-related spills of petroleum or hazardous chemicals <br>were<i> </i>reported in the aftermath of the storm. Ten major to medium oil spills have fouled the Mississippi River from <br>Chalmette to Venice and west to Port Fourchon, releasing a total of nearly 8 million gallons of oil, and the Coast Guard <br>estimates that the region endured approximately 134 minor spills of less than 10,000 gallons each (see Table 5). (By way <br>of comparison, the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> disaster resulted in the release of 11 million gallons of oil.) The flood-affected area has <br>some 2,200 underground fuel tanks, an unknown percentage of which ruptured in the storm.21 Post-storm testing by <br>local and national environmental groups, the EPA, and state officials confirmed that many formerly flooded areas were <br>contaminated with pathogens and toxic chemicals, often at concentrations significantly higher than federal and even lax <br>state safety guidelines. At most of these major oil spill sites, cleanup is ongoing.<br>

<b>Gert Town: A Community with a Legacy of Environmental Abuse</b><br>
 <br>
The New Orleans community of Gert Town, site of the former Thompson-Hayward pesticide blending and <br>
storage facility, highlights the problems associated with pre-storm contamination. Gert Town is a low-income area <br>where the residents, overwhelmingly African-American, earn an average household income of less than $23,000. 22 At <br>the edge of the community is a one-block plot where the Thompson-Hayward company began producing pesticides <br>such as Agent Orange and DDT in 1941. Production stopped in the mid-1970s, but until the 1980s the company still <br>used the facility as a warehouse for a number of dangerous pesticides, including aldrin, dieldren, chlordane, and DDT.<br> <br>
In 1987 municipal workers discovered that sewers adjacent to the facility were contaminated with toxic <br>
components of dry-cleaning fluid. A state-ordered cleanup ensued, in which 75,000 gallons of toxic liquids and <br>millions of pounds of soil were removed. However, an estimated 2,600 tons of herbicide-contaminated soil was left <br>behind because no state would accept it for disposal. Outrage in the community surrounding the facility led to a <br>protracted legal battle that resulted in a $51 million settlement.23<br> <br>
Hurricane Katrina brought a renewed pesticide threat to Gert Town when it flooded the community with six <br>
feet of water, prompting worries that the pesticide residue would spread. NRDC sampling done around the site and <br>in the surrounding residential neighborhood in the immediate aftermath of the storm showed those worries to be <br>well founded. Tests showed that the level of DDT and one of its breakdown products in the sediment exceeded the <br>EPA soil-cleanup levels by about twofold. Two other organochlorine pesticides—dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide, a <br>breakdown product of heptachlor—were also significantly in excess of the cleanup levels, with the dieldrin level  <br>nearly seven times higher.24 <br> <br>
When floodwaters engulfed the facility, they carried away pesticides that had not been removed as part of the <br>
state-ordered cleanup in the 1980s, and then spread these pesticides throughout the surrounding area. These pesticides  <br>are so toxic and persistent in the environment—that is, they do not break down into safer components—that they  <br>have been banned for use in the United States for more than 25 years, and are now banned worldwide by  <br>international treaty. <br> <br>
Since Katrina, onsite but not offsite cleanup has been instituted at the Thompson-Haywood site.25 Due to <br>
pressure by Advocates for Environmental Human Rights, on-site remediation was completed using excavation and  <br>off-site disposal in July 2007.<br>

A Mountain of Trash  <br>Left Behind <br>
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita combined to deposit as much as 100 million <br>
cubic yards of debris in the New Orleans area, much of it mixed with <br>hazardous chemicals.26 This waste includes household items of every <br>
sort, garbage, unknown amounts of hazardous materials from both residential and <br>commercial sources, white goods (such as household appliances), vehicles, electronics, <br>vegetation, and demolition debris. Two years later, the task of cleaning up the <br>enormous quantity of debris is far from finished. <br>
As many as 350,000 automobiles and other vehicles were flooded and ruined by the storms. The gasoline and other <br>toxic fluids in these vehicles—as much as three million gallons, by some estimates—pose a severe threat to returning <br>residents.27 After Katrina, sediment testing detected levels of diesel fuel contaminants that exceeded the national and <br>state cleanup standards. Benzo(a)pyrene, a petroleum chemical that causes various cancers in animals28 and is associated <br>with lung cancer in humans,29 was also detected above state cleanup levels. Petroleum-based substances degrade over time <br>if they are exposed to heat and open air, but it is unclear how much contamination from gasoline and other toxic fuels <br>remains below the surface, in the deeper soil and groundwater. Rather than assuming the contamination will take care of <br>itself, it is imperative that public agencies continue monitoring the soil and groundwater to ensure the continued safety <br>of the people and environment of New Orleans.<br>
An unknown quantity of toxic materials from home garages and storage areas, such as pesticides, solvents, and cleaning <br>agents, also found its way into flood waters. One of the most significant types of Katrina-related debris still in the area <br>has yet to be addressed: the tens of thousands of flood-ruined structures, many of which are likely to contain hazardous <br>materials such as lead, asbestos, household hazardous waste, and other toxins. Asbestos, a chemical linked to serious lung <br>problems and cancer, was once a widely used building material in the South because of its resistance to extreme heat. As <br>the rebuilding process continues, the release of airborne asbestos is a significant concern. <br>

<hr>
<A name=19></a>To date, the Army Corps of Engineers—under the supervision of FEMA and with input from the EPA and state <br>environmental officials—has been largely responsible for addressing the massive debris problem. Waste management <br>activities thus far have included modest efforts to separate white goods, vehicles (cars and boats), household hazardous <br>waste, and vegetation from the large stream of hurricane-related debris. But these efforts have been slow and <br>uncoordinated, and there has been little if any effort dedicated to developing a more comprehensive debris separation, <br>reuse, recycling, and composting program, which could safely divert millions of tons of waste away from  <br>Louisiana landfills.30 <br>
<b>Superfund and Other Hazardous Waste Sites <br></b>At least two Superfund sites in the New Orleans area were flooded by Katrina. The Agriculture Street Landfill held <br>decades of municipal garbage and hazardous waste that contained lead, arsenic, dioxin, and carcinogenic hydrocarbons <br>(see “Agriculture Street Landfill Seeps Toxins into Community”). The Southern Shipbuilding site in Slidell included <br>pits and lagoons containing 35,000 cubic yards of sludge contaminated with cancer-causing polyaromatic hydrocarbons <br>(PAHs) covering approximately eight acres. 31 Dozens of other hazardous waste sites in Louisiana, Mississippi, and <br>Alabama were also in the path of Katrina and Rita. Data about their safety are still being collected.32 <br>
<b>  Agriculture Street Landfill Seeps Toxins into Community </b><br>
 <br>
The Agriculture Street Landfill in New Orleans was originally the site of a municipal dump dating back to  <br>
the early 1900s. The city closed the 95-acre site in 1958, but reopened it seven years later for debris from 1965’s <br>Hurricane Betsy. Waste of all sorts was piled onto the site and burned for a period of six months before it was finally <br>covered with ash and again closed. <br> <br>
In the 1970s, the site—which had once been sprayed with DDT—became home to an ill-conceived housing <br>
development.33 The 390 housing units had approximately 1,000 residents, most low-income African-Americans.34  <br>In 1994, after years of lobbying by community leaders, the city built a fence around an undeveloped part of the <br>landfill, removed contaminated soil from play areas on the site, and took steps to register the area as a Superfund <br>site. The EPA ordered in 1998 that the site be cleaned of its toxic load of lead, arsenic, dioxin, and carcinogenic <br>hydrocarbons.35 <br> <br>
Then Katrina flooded the area, and subsequent testing by the EPA, NRDC, the Louisiana Environmental <br>
Action Network, Subra Company, and the <i>San Antonio News Express</i>, found dangerously elevated levels of PAHs, <br>cancer-causing chemicals from soot and petroleum-based products.36 NRDC’s testers reported that leachate was  <br>visibly leaking from the landfill site, spreading across the street and onto the grounds of the local senior  <br>citizens’ center. Tests of this oily-appearing leachate revealed the elevated levels of PAHs.37<br> <br>
With mountains of debris continuing to clog the city more than two years after the storms, it is critical that <br>
mismanagement of Katrina-related debris does not become the latest addition to the list of burdens being borne by  <br>the people of New Orleans. <br>

<A name=20></a><b>CHAPTER 4</b><br>
Storms Shine a Spotlight on <br>Environmental Injustice<br>
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita focused new attention on the deterioration and <br>
degradation of Louisiana’s coastal landscapes and the toxic legacy of years <br>of environmental abuse. The residents of southern Louisiana were hit hard, <br>
not just by the storms but also by the government’s failure to prepare for and respond <br>to their inevitable and devastating effects.38 The grim reality is that the damage done <br>by the storms might have been less severe were it not for years of careless and flagrant <br>abuse of the environment. <br>
Poor environmental policy decisions made long before Katrina combined with natural forces to create the worst disaster <br>to befall an American city in decades. These institutional failures of environmental management and emergency response <br>have left many residents struggling to rebuild their homes, livelihoods, and communities.39 With the wealthier areas of <br>the city largely situated on higher ground and insulated from the worst impacts, it is the poor and minority residents <br>who have been hardest hit. More than a century of laws and policies steering African-Americans and the poor to low-<br>lying, flood-prone areas left these disadvantaged communities exposed to the most severe storm damage. Louisiana also <br>has a long history of state-sponsored incentives for industrial expansion that have resulted in a proliferation of polluting <br>industries along the backyard fence lines of low-income communities and communities of color.40 In Katrina’s wake, <br>these neighborhoods were devastated, depopulated, and contaminated—and remain so to this day.<br>
<b>Bad Environmental Policy Worsened the Disaster<br></b>As ferocious as the hurricanes were, the loss of life and property might not have been as profound but for a series of <br>bad decisions made by government and business leaders in the decades preceding the storms. Many years of resource <br>exploitation contributed to the scope of the disaster, first by robbing the area of some of its natural defenses against <br>flooding, and second by introducing a host of hazardous substances into the floodwaters. <br>
Natural Resources Defense Council  I <b>20   </b><br>
<hr>
<A name=21></a><i><b>Diminished Wetlands Could Not Protect the Louisiana Coast</b></i> <br>Years of poor government and industry stewardship destroyed much of the region’s wetlands, depriving the area of more <br>than a million acres of land that might have absorbed part of the storms’ fury. Hurricane winds sent a surge of saltwater <br>inland, flooding tens of thousands of acres of freshwater marsh. Much of the water became trapped inside levees designed <br>to keep it out, where it mixed with oil spills and effluent from ruined houses, businesses, and sewage-treatment plants. <br>The resulting ecological damage exacerbated an already severe environmental problem that had been decades in the <br>making.<br>
Healthy coastal wetlands provide critical habitat and food resources and act as natural buffers against hurricanes. Experts <br>estimate that every 2.7 miles of coastal wetlands along the Gulf Coast reduces storm surge by about a foot.41 But over <br>the past 75 years, Louisiana has lost more than 1.2 million acres of its coastal wetlands.42 That loss continues today at a <br>rate of 24 square miles per year, with the hurricanes accelerating that loss.43 Most of this wetlands loss has been caused <br>by human intervention in the form of navigational channels, oil and gas infrastructure, and levees—particularly the <br>building of levees on the Mississippi River for flood control and navigation purposes.44 While these levees provided the <br>needed flood protection, they also prevented vital land-building sediments and nutrients from replenishing and elevating <br>deteriorating marshes. Instead of feeding into wetlands, sediment followed man-made channels into the Gulf of Mexico.<br>
This system of channels provides navigation for commerce as well as access to oil rigs and other industrial facilities, but <br>during Katrina it became a “hurricane highway,” allowing stormwater to sweep rapidly inland, bypassing marshland on a <br>direct course toward New Orleans. A prime culprit was the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR GO), a 76-mile shortcut <br>from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.45 The construction and maintenance of this little-used navigation <br>channel over the past 40 years has destroyed 20,000 acres of coastal land in St. Bernard Parish. It is believed to have <br>channeled the Katrina storm surge into some of the most vulnerable areas of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish.46 <br>
<i><b>Oil and Gas Industry Pollution Opened the Door for Toxic Contamination<br></b></i>Over the years, environmentally disastrous choices were made to create and store toxic waste and to allow serious <br>contamination of soils and underwater sediments in an area that annually faces the threat of severe hurricanes. These <br>choices led to a commingling of toxic contamination and floodwaters that spread poisons throughout the region. <br>
With its huge reserves of crude oil, Louisiana ranks fifth among the 50 states in oil production, generating about 4 <br>percent of total U.S. crude oil.47 The state has nearly 20,000 producing oil wells and a large network of crude oil <br>pipelines, liquefied petroleum gas pipelines, and storage facilities. Louisiana is also home to two of the four U.S. Strategic <br>Petroleum Reserve storage facilities, at West Hackberry in Cameron Parish and at Bayou Choctaw in Iberville Parish. The <br>state’s 19 petroleum refineries have a combined crude oil distillation capacity of nearly 2.8 million barrels per calendar <br>day, second only to Texas. <br>
The inevitable byproduct of these industries is hazardous waste, and Louisiana ranks second, again behind Texas, in the <br>quantity of hazardous industrial waste generated. Calculated on a per capita basis, Louisiana actually leads the nation.48 <br>Rather than imposing and enforcing meaningful environmental standards, the state government has generally catered to <br>industry, even going so far as to promote the state’s southern bayous as a potential disposal area for other states’  <br>hazardous waste.49 <br>
<b>Reconstructing New Orleans for the Future<br></b>The reconstruction of New Orleans and the surrounding areas must be informed by past mistakes, so decision makers <br>can steer clear of the calamitous choices that exacerbated the damage done by the storms of 2005. Industry can and <br>should return, but it must learn to do business in ways that do not subject the region to toxic waste or contaminated soils <br>
Natural Resources Defense Council  I <b>21   </b><br>
<hr>
<A name=22></a>and sediments. The water management infrastructure—including dams, levees, and channels—must be planned so that <br>it no longer robs the region of its needed wetlands or funnels stormwater straight at the heart of New Orleans.<br>
Importantly, rebuilding also presents a unique opportunity to build a modern and sustainable city, one that preserves <br>New Orleans’s unique architecture and spirit while leaving its citizens less vulnerable to environmental disaster. The new <br>New Orleans should be a city where neighborhoods are separated from industry, so that there are no longer any low-<br>income citizens living just beyond industrial fence lines, exposed to toxins with every breath they draw. It should be a <br>place where transportation from home to work and back does not demand a daily overdose of air pollution.<br>
The reconstruction process will take years; various stakeholders are still arguing over what areas of the city will be  <br>rebuilt and how the rebuilding will be done. Nearly two years after Katrina and Rita, little progress has been made on  <br>the long-term environmental and economic issues confronting the region. Its citizens deserve better. Policymakers, <br>business leaders, and community officials must be willing to commit energy and resources to building a sustainable <br>environment for Louisiana’s coast, address serious public health questions, and create an efficient and effective disaster-<br>preparedness system. <br>
<b>The EPA Fails to Protect the Health of New Orleans Residents<br></b>After Katrina, a natural disaster of unprecedented scope and scale, the affected communities looked to their local, <br>state, and federal government for support and assistance. Communities not only sought immediate disaster response <br>assistance but also guidance regarding whether it was safe to return home. Residents expected that if the government <br>found toxic contamination, it would exercise its authority to the fullest extent to clean it up and protect residents. But <br>the Environmental Protection Agency—the nation’s primary body of expertise and regulatory enforcement authority for <br>controlling and responding to environmental threats to public health—decided early on to punt its responsibility.<br>
It did so in two major ways. First, the agency declared that it had no authority or responsibility to monitor or address <br>indoor air pollution, claiming that the mold threat was an indoor air problem despite NRDC data demonstrating <br>extremely high mold levels even in outdoor air in flooded areas.50 Second, with regard to toxic sediment, the EPA <br>deferred to local authorities—which often lacked the staff of environmental health experts and access to scientific <br>resources available to the national agency—regardless of the fact that EPA had primary responsibility to protect citizens’ <br>health in the wake of the massive Katrina-related oil and hazardous chemical releases. <br>
The EPA itself noted on its Katrina home page, “In emergency situations such as this, <i>EPA serves as the lead Agency</i> for <br>the cleanup of hazardous materials.”51 But surprisingly, the EPA repeatedly stated after the hurricanes that it was not the <br>agency’s obligation to decide whether environmental conditions in New Orleans and other areas affected by toxins and <br>oil pollution were so dangerous as to warrant continued quarantine or additional cleanup prior to general repopulation <br>of the affected areas. In short, the EPA refused to make any explicit public statements about whether it was safe for <br>the public to return to New Orleans and other hard-hit areas. This reluctance was especially puzzling in light of the <br>staggering amount of the agency’s own sampling data demonstrating significant toxic contamination.<br>
It was not until August 17, 2006, a year after the hurricanes, that the EPA officially made the explicit public statement <br>that “adverse health effects would not be expected from exposure to contaminated sediments from the previously flooded <br>areas, provided people use common sense and good personal hygiene and safety practice.”52 When the announcement <br>was finally made, an estimated 190,000 residents<b> </b>had already returned to previously flooded areas and were potentially <br>already at risk.53 <br>

<A name=23></a><b>CHAPTER 5</b><br>
Charting a New Course  <br>for New Orleans<br>
Hurricane Katrina was one of the greatest disasters in the history of the <br>
United States. Now, two years after the storm tore through the city, we <br>must ensure that our handling of the toxic chemicals and mountains of <br>
debris left behind by the storms does not compound this tragedy by passing on a toxic <br>legacy for future generations. Expansive and systemized solutions will be needed to <br>protect the long-term safety of residents rebuilding their city. This section outlines <br>some first steps for rebuilding New Orleans. <br>
<b>Protecting Public Health<br>1.   Ensure safe and healthy schools for returning children.<br></b> <br>
Flood-damaged schools should be rebuilt in a manner that fully protects children’s health. Rebuilt schools should <br>be LEED-certified and incorporate guidelines developed by the Collaborative for High Performance Schools for the <br>design of energy-efficient, healthy, comfortable, well-lit schools. Care should be taken to make design, engineering, <br>and materials choices that prevent mold from growing indoors. The city also should guarantee that soil on school <br>grounds is clean and safe by making sure it is tested and cleaned to at least the  level of the most protective cleanup <br>guidelines in the country.<br>
<b>2.   Remove contaminated sediments.<br></b> <br>
The city should immediately request that FEMA and the EPA remove contaminated sediment from New Orleans’s <br>communities and conduct further investigation and remediation of toxic hot spots.<br>
Natural Resources Defense Council  I <b>23   </b><br>
<hr>
<A name=24></a><b>3.   Monitor the air and water.<br></b> <br>
There is a need for ongoing monitoring of the air and water quality in New Orleans. In many cases, no data are <br>available since 2006, yet we know that there were documented problems with mold, endotoxin, heavy-metal-<br>contaminated particulate matter, and drinking water contamination. These findings need to be followed up to <br>ensure they have resolved.<br>
<b>4.   Fully inform the public of health risks.<br></b> <br>
The city should ensure that state and federal agencies continue to fully assess health risks for residents returning to <br>contaminated areas before making any official declarations that it is safe for them to do so.<br>
<b>5.   Initiate state legislative hearings on cleanup.<br></b> <br>
The city should request that the Louisiana legislature hold hearings on the sediment contamination health threat and <br>the need for sediment cleanup/remediation. The city also should push for more public and legislative dialogue on the <br>issues of rebuilding and debris and waste management.<br>
<b>6.   Give residents access to treatment for exposure to toxins.<br></b> <br>
The city should demand that the federal Public Health Service and Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry <br>provide ongoing medical care and testing to residents exposed to toxins, as required by the Comprehensive <br>Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (section 104(i)(1)).<br>
<b>7.   Restore coastal wetlands.<br></b> <br>
Decades of industrial misuse and government-sponsored reengineering gone awry have almost completely destroyed <br>the Gulf of Mexico’s natural coastal barriers. The city should work with federal and state officials to ensure they <br>adopt a major coastal wetland restoration program in the Louisiana Delta. <br>
<b>Ridding the City of Hazardous Waste and Debris<br></b>Tens of thousands of buildings will need to be demolished due to irreparable structural damage or because of the impact <br>of petroleum spills, mold growth, and other contamination. This demolition process will generate an enormous quantity <br>of debris, which is likely to contain hazardous materials such as lead, asbestos, household hazardous waste, and other <br>toxins. Rebuilding the city will also generate significant quantities of construction debris, which will only add to the <br>debris management burden.<br>
The city must act now to adopt a forward-looking debris management strategy that complies with EPA requirements for <br>“integrated waste management.” The recommendations below, in addition to offering wiser debris management choices, <br>suggest actions that will contribute meaningfully to New Orleans’s economic recovery by creating jobs, generating <br>marketable products for recovery/rebuilding efforts, and facilitating the development of an active marketplace for <br>reconstruction materials. <br>
<b>1.  Practice deconstruction, not demolition.<br></b>  Instead of knocking a building down with heavy equipment and carting the resulting debris away as a mixed <br>
aggregate of solid waste, deconstruction involves deliberate dismantling of a structure to separate its component <br>materials. The ability to effectively take advantage of building deconstruction requires development of a well-thought-<br>out process for: <br>
   <br>
•  on-site deconstruction, separation, sorting, and diversion of debris materials; <br>
   <br>
•  transport of debris to temporary staging/sorting/distribution locations; <br>
   <br>
•  distribution of constituent materials to recycling facilities, construction or restoration projects, or other  <br>
 <br>
  processors or end users; and <br>
   <br>
•  proper disposal of debris that cannot be otherwise salvaged for a useful purpose.<br>
Natural Resources Defense Council  I <b>24   </b><br>
<hr>
<A name=25></a><b>2.  Recycle, reuse, and compost.</b> <br>  A cleanup plan that emphasizes these three components would benefit the health of New Orleans’s communities, <br>
reduce the need for landfill space, facilitate economic recovery, and allow the city to respond much more quickly (and <br>more sensibly) to future disasters. <br>
  An effective recycling plan must include, at minimum: <br>   <br>
•  Recycling of aggregate (brick, masonry, etc.);<br>
   <br>
•  Recycling of metals (roofing materials, appliances, piping, wiring, etc.);<br>
   <br>
•  Recycling of nonmetal roofing materials;<br>
   <br>
•  Recycling of glass and ceramics;<br>
   <br>
•  Recycling of plastics;<br>
   <br>
•  Recycling (or reuse) of clean lumber; and<br>
   <br>
•  Composting of any suitable organic materials (including soils).<br>
<b>3.  Emphasize proper waste disposal. <br></b>  New Orleans can ensure that its waste disposal process adequately protects the public by: <br>   <br>
•  Identifying specific procedures and targets for removing hazardous components of the disaster debris  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
  (including household hazardous waste and asbestos);<br>
   <br>
•  Avoiding the creation of new landfills if possible; <br>
   <br>
•  Banning the use of open burning as a debris management strategy (including use of “air curtain  <br>
 <br>
  incinerators”);<br>
   <br>
•  Using appropriate types of landfill that consider the nature and characteristics of the waste;<br>
   <br>
•  Applying appropriate siting procedures, including meaningful public participation criteria and  <br>
 <br>
  environmental justice principles for new landfills, if necessary; and<br>
   <br>
•  Planning to remediate existing landfills (such as the Chef Menteur landfill) that contain potentially  <br>
 <br>
  harmful inappropriate wastes.<br>
<b>4.  Establish an effective process for debris management. <br></b>  New Orleans must pursue a community-centered, public-private collaboration that is transparent and accountable. <br>
The city should join with the state of Louisiana and relevant federal agencies to form a multidisciplinary stakeholder <br>task force whose mission is to help the city quickly develop short- and long-term recommendations for dealing with <br>post-Katrina solid waste and debris. <br>
<b>Federal Cleanup Solutions: Recommendations for the 110th Congress</b><br>
 <br>
As the 110th Congress continues its work, we recommend the following actions:<b> </b><br>
Meetings with senior officials at the appropriate federal agencies charged with natural-disaster responsibilities—<br>FEMA, the EPA, and the Army Corps of Engineers—to demand action on the above priorities, accountability for past <br>problems, and proactive measures for future storm seasons.<br> <br>
Coordinated lobby days in Congress, with affected community members and environmental, civil rights, and <br>
faith groups supporting legislation to address wetlands restoration and action to assure the rebuilding and cleanup  <br>of the area, including homes, schools, and other buildings affected by the hurricanes.<br> <br>
A joint demand for oversight hearings on reconstruction activities by the relevant federal agencies, and on <br>
agency plans for handling future natural disasters, by the appropriate oversight committees in Congress.<br> <br>
Investment of additional organizational resources in the sustainable renewal and green revitalization of the  <br>
Gulf region.The problems left behind by Hurricane Katrina are our nation’s responsibility. It will take a sustained <br>national effort to rebuild, revitalize, and realize a new, sustainable, and just New Orleans for the future.<br>

<A name=26></a><b>Appendix A: Arsenic Sampling Methodology, March 2007<br>1. </b>  85 residential locations in the City of New Orleans had concentrations of arsenic above the LDEQ clean-up <br>
guideline of 22 mg/kg in sediment according to EPA sampling conducted September 2005 through June 2006;<br>
<b>2. </b>  These locations were matched using GIS software to the closest soil sample collected pre-Katrina by Dr. Howard <br>
Mielke (Tulane-Xavier) and available in his soil archive;<br>
<b>3.</b>  65 matched pre-flood samples were available, most within 400 meters of the original location. Twenty locations were <br>
not matched because there was insufficient archived sample or because the sampling points were close together and <br>the matched location was a duplicate;<br>
<b>4.</b>  65 stored soil samples were analyzed for arsenic using EPA method 6010b;<br>
<b>5.  </b>118 residential, school, and playground sites in the City of New Orleans were sampled in March 2007 and analyzed <br>
for arsenic using EPA method 6010b;<br>
<b>6.</b>  65 of these sampling locations were located within one block of sites where previous EPA sampling found elevated <br>
levels of arsenic;<br>
<b>7.</b>  Two samples were omitted from this analysis, resulting in 63 matched residential area samples and a total of 116 <br>
samples from March 2007.<br>
<b>Appendix B: EPA Legal Authorities and Obligations to Respond to Natural Disasters <br></b>The EPA’s decision to defer to local agencies to make determinations of whether it was safe for residents to return to <br>New Orleans appeared to undermine its own legal authority under such laws as the Clean Water Act (CWA); Resource <br>Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act <br>(CERCLA, or Superfund); and Oil Pollution Act (OPA). Moreover, under its own National Contingency Plan (NCP) <br>regulations, the EPA carried the lead responsibility for evaluating and acting to remedy environmental health threats. <br>
In particular, NCP regulations impose numerous obligations on the EPA to ensure that its response to releases of <br>hazardous substances or oil protects exposed citizens. For example, the NCP requires that after an oil spill, “[d]efensive <br>actions<i> shall</i> begin as soon as possible to prevent, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to the public health or welfare of the <br>United States or the environment.”54 Moreover, if “the discharge poses or may present a substantial threat to public <br>health or welfare of the United States, the [EPA representative] <i>shall</i> direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove <br>the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a discharge, as appropriate.”55 Similarly, RCRA states that once <br>the EPA knows of hazardous waste at any site that presents an “imminent and substantial endangerment to human health <br>or the environment,” then the EPA “<i>shall</i> provide immediate notice to the appropriate local government agencies” and <br>“<i>shall</i> require notice of such endangerment to be promptly posted at the site where the waste is located.”56 <br>
Under these laws, the EPA bears the lead responsibility for evaluating and acting to remedy environmental health <br>threats. While it is clear that local and state authorities also share in the legal obligation to assure that local residents are <br>protected from such environmental health threats, under federal law, when there is such a declared national emergency <br>and a significant threat from hazardous substances and oil, the EPA bears the responsibility of being “the lead agency” for <br>assuring public health protection from these environmental health threats. <br>
The EPA has also often used its Superfund authorities and funding for hazardous waste removal actions and relocations <br>of entire at-risk populations, but the Superfund is now largely bankrupt because Congress has ended the chemical and <br>
Natural Resources Defense Council  I <b>26   </b><br>
<hr>
<A name=27></a>oil industry fee that funded it. Consequently, all cleanup and relocation costs now must come directly from the EPA’s <br>budget, and ultimately from taxpayers. This has served as a political disincentive for the EPA to exercise its authority to <br>order site cleanup and to protect residents from environmental hazards. <br>
In addition to Superfund, each of the EPA’s major statutes—such as the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), RCRA, <br>CWA—includes a plenary “imminent and substantial endangerment” provision. The provision allows the EPA to go to <br>court and/or issue administrative orders to force essentially any action that the EPA believes is necessary to protect public <br>health or the environment from an imminent and substantial endangerment due to a release or threatened release of <br>hazardous chemicals or petroleum. The term “imminent and substantial endangerment” has been read by the courts very <br>broadly to favor EPA intervention whenever there is a reasonable question about the safety to the public posed by toxic <br>pollution. RCRA, for example, lets the EPA sue or issue orders to force action “as may be necessary” to protect the public <br>from waste pollution. SDWA provides the EPA broad authority to issue orders or sue to force action to protect public <br>health from possible contamination of water supplies or underground water. Similarly, CWA gives the EPA authority <br>to respond to such endangerment by suing for actions “as may be necessary” to force anyone causing or contributing to <br>pollution to take any action needed to protect public health or the environment.<br>
The exercise of some of these powers is not unprecedented. In the past, the EPA has relocated people from <br>contaminated homes, and it has sometimes even relocated entire communities (such as Times Beach, Missouri; the <br>Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York, public housing residents in Portsmouth, Virginia; and, more recently, a large <br>number of pesticide-contaminated homes in Mississippi, Louisiana, and other states) due to hazardous substance <br>contamination. EPA has also tested air quality inside private homes in the past. In 1994 the agency took samples <br>in 9,000 houses in Ohio after a highly toxic pesticide was illegally sprayed in the community. The EPA eventually <br>decontaminated 1,000 homes.57 Yet in New Orleans, the EPA claimed it did not have the authority or responsibility to <br>test for contamination inside homes or to decontaminate homes. <br>
Taken together with numerous other legal authorities, it is clear that Congress intended that the EPA have the authority <br>to take sweeping actions as lead agency in the case of such nationally declared emergencies to protect the people of New <br>Orleans and other communities from toxic contamination. <br>
<i><b>EPA Failure to Exercise Legal Authorities<br></b></i>After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, a lawsuit was brought against the EPA for its failure <br>to act on its legal authorities to clean up environmental contamination at the site.58 Throughout the litigation, the EPA <br>denied that it had any explicit responsibility to act in response to the disaster. Specifically, the EPA argued that it was not <br>required to act to protect workers or the public from environmental contaminants, but that it could do so voluntarily at <br>its own discretion.59 The statement, although shocking, was also extremely revealing regarding the EPA’s reluctance to <br>exercise the multitude of legal authorities it possessed to clean up and protect people from environmental contaminants <br>in a time of disaster. The court found that in the case of the September 11 attacks and under the six provisions of the <br>NCP that the plaintiffs relied on, the plaintiffs did not identify a mandatory duty to act under the provisions of the NCP. <br>In other words, the court decided that residents do not have a legal right to force the EPA to use its authority. Instead, <br>the EPA is free to decide when to act. <br>
The September 11 litigation provides helpful insight into explaining why EPA chose not to exercise its legal authorities <br>after Katrina. In the aftermath of September 11, it was clear that the EPA recognized it had the authority to protect <br>workers and the public from toxic contaminants. Nonetheless, the agency bent to political pressure and failed to take <br>charge of the cleanup, instead announcing to the public that everything was fine.<br>
In the case of Katrina, with environmental ramifications on an even greater scale, the EPA was even more careful to avoid <br>making statements regarding the safety of returning residents. At first, the EPA avoided making any formal declarations <br>
Natural Resources Defense Council  I <b>27   </b><br>
<hr>
<A name=28></a>regarding the safety of returning to previously flooded areas. However, at the same time, the agency released advisories <br>recommending that residents take all precautions that one would take if there were significant toxic contamination.60 <br>The advisories ranged from recommending that people shower often, wash their hands regularly, change clothes often, <br>and use washable doormats, to encouraging the use of respirators in previously flooded areas and avoiding activities that <br>generate dust.61 <br>
The EPA’s careful attempt to walk the line between saying it was “safe” and “unsafe” was clear early on. EPA’s reluctance <br>to issue firm guidance resulted in confusion among residents and relief workers who, as a result, may have exposed <br>themselves to unnecessary risks. Shortly after the hurricanes, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson responded to exactly <br>this question by saying:62<br>
“Well, unfortunately it’s not a yes or a no answer because, again, what we’re seeing in the sediment area  <br>is that we’re seeing some of those sediments highly contaminated with petroleum products and for those  <br>areas that have high contamination you really shouldn’t be coming in contact with it. For those areas with  <br>very low contamination there’s probably not a health consequence with but still prudent advice would <br>be—common-sense advice would be to avoid exposure, take precaution.”<br>
By sending mixed signals that on one hand it was “safe” to return, but on the other hand people should significantly <br>alter their normal daily behavior to guard against toxic exposure, EPA performed a grave disservice to returning residents <br>by allowing them to be exposed to known environmental hazards. Furthermore, Johnson’s admission that “high <br>contamination” was a problem in some areas in New Orleans is troublesome in light of the agency’s decision to not take <br>any cleanup actions regarding the contaminated sediment. <br>
In New York, the EPA’s failure to act backfired—the agency is facing extensive criticism from New Yorkers who feel that <br>the respiratory illnesses they developed subsequent to September 11 could have been avoided if EPA had disclosed the <br>potential health threats of dust exposure at the site. The long-term health effects of exposure to post-Katrina conditions <br>remain unknown. The EPA can show it learned from its experience after September 11 by stepping up to protect public <br>health in post-Katrina New Orleans. <br>
