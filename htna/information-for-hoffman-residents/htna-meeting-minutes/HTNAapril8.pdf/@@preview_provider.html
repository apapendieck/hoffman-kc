<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336px;left:90px"><nobr><span class="ft3">Glad that this is becoming such an active community association.  Good news is that <br>NORA has identified Hoffman as a pilot program to take pre-Katrina blighted properties <br>and bring back into commerce to the area.  NORA will come to community to get input <br>on what Hoffman residents want.  (i.e. double, single homes, rates, quality construction, <br>etc.) <br> <br>Taylor park is slated to get money from disaster relief fund.  Hoffman elementary not a <br>fast-track, (completed by school year 2009) but will speed up process in the interim.  <br>There is still some question as to whether to tear down or rebuild and renovate the school.  <br>Schools make strong community. <br> <br>Claiborne Ave:  wants to bring grocery stores, kids clothing stores, etc.  she is working <br>hard to recruit and bring retail to area.  There is a fund of $10,000 total to hire a retail <br>consultant to recruit businesses to come to community. <br>  <br>$2 million has also be slated toward Claiborne avenue for a beautification of neutral <br>ground project.  Community input is needed to determine what would be the most <br>appropriate use of neutral ground.  (A bike path vs. streetscapes)  The Regional Planning <br>Commission hired someone to draft improved street-scape plan.  An improved street –<br>scape will encourage more developers to the area.   <br><b> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </b></span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:75px;left:90px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><b>Discussion open for Questions and Concerns:</b><i> <br> <br>Big problem with trash dumping.  What can be done to solve this problem?  <br></i>Take license plates number or contact the sanitation department, and they have been quite <br>aggressive in prosecuting offenders.  There has been 15 prosecutions and 1 person in jail.  <br>Find out where the offenders are coming from if possible. Fines have been increased, <br>maybe $500.   <br> <br><i>Problem with water drainage in the neighborhood: <br></i>Email or call with exact address where problems occurs.  Street repairs will be paid for <br>by FEMA, (that’s the reason for delay)  but Public Works Department needs to know <br>where the problems occur.  Could be as simple as cleaning out the drains. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:253px;left:90px"><nobr><span class="ft5">History of problem:  In the past, everyone on block would have to agree to get subsurface <br>drainage i.e. camp st.  This explains gaps in drainage, where 30-40 years ago people <br>didn’t’ agree to install subsurface drainage. We need to fix the old system.  The City <br>Doesn’t do bonding for individuals.  Mill and overlay is inexpensive but need to dig up, <br>put in infrastructure so its very disruptive.  </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:337px;left:90px"><nobr><span class="ft5"><i>Live below the gas line.  Resident has to do repairs by itself <br></i>This is an issue for Entergy.  Resident needs to contact them directly and provide them <br>with an exact location.  Call Barbara Lacey Keller in Stacy Head’s office and she will <br>follow up on the problems. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:391px;left:108px"><nobr><span class="ft1"> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:406px;left:90px"><nobr><span class="ft4"><i>People are rebuilding but not using dumpsters <br></i>Bundle materials in owner supply material (boxes, trash bags).  Then they can call the <br>sanitation department and get unlimited pick up for free.  If they don’t do this, call the <br>authority and report them. <br> <br><i>Is the lot next door program in effect?   <br></i>You need to transfer records to your name. NORA will go through procedural <br>requirements, (pay taxes, debts, etc) or if the owner chooses not to, they will do an <br>expropriation.  NORA gets properties then neighbors get the notification.  Have to let <br>NORA know that you are interested and must pay market value or 50% of the property.  <br>Can’t happen until NORA gets those properties back on the market.  (See RALLY <br>handout for specifics) <br> <br><i>NORA wants to come to the next meeting to make presentation. Should we invite them?</i></span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:598px;left:90px"><nobr><span class="ft4">YES <br> <br><i>What can the neighborhood association do? <br></i>Have a community voice to the extent possible.  Need to agree on things, and my job is to <br>create a vision for community that you want.   <br> <br><i>Our main concern is the lack of grocery store. </i></span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:74px;left:90px"><nobr><span class="ft7">I’m currently talking to local grocers to put a smaller store with basic foods in it to test <br>the market.  On a National level, larger retailers are on hold and no expansion.  Orleans <br>parish currently has 12,000 people per grocery store.  Jefferson parish at 130% higher <br>sales than pre-K (we going to Jefferson parish to buy foods) while our neighborhoods are <br>without a store.  Need to work on this issue. <br> <br><b>Quality of Life Officer: <br></b> <br>Stacy Head addressed a lot of these issues. Call 311 with street light issues. <br>Copper theft is a growing problem in this neighborhood. Biggest problem is churches.  <br>They put pipes in and thieves tear them down immediately.  If you see a truck with <br>copper or any unusual things, call the NUMBER. <br> <br>NeighborWatch is a program that police department is trying to implement. If you see <br>something wrong by your neighborhoods property give them a call.  Work together to <br>solve time.  The Main deal is “Look out for each other”.  Keep tools by you, construction <br>theft is also a growing problem.   <br> <br><b>Open discussion to Questions and General Disscussion: <br></b> <br><i>Concern about the park lights.  It’s too dark in the park, there is lots of activity and you <br>don’t know what is going on, gun shots etc.  What can we do as a community to deal with <br>lighting?  <br></i>Set timers to 9 pm.   <br> <br><i>They go off at 7:30 and kids are still over there playing. There is also increased drug <br>activity in the neighborhood.</i></span></nobr></DIV>

Recent discussion included <br>targeting that area around the park and “take it back”   <br> <br><i>Is it possible to put together a STD mobile unit to pass out information to talk about the <br>spread of disease?  <br></i>Yes, NOAIDS has a mobile clinic.  Contact them and they will be happy to help. <br> <br>If people don’t want the police showing up at their house you can 504-282-2222 for <br>police.  Call Sergeant Kalka directly about copper theft at 504-658-6312. <br> <br><i>Abandoned house across the street.  I called the police, and they said they wouldn’t come <br>unless he was outside.  General concern about lack of responsiveness from 911. <br></i>If you are not satisfied, call and ask for the supervisor.  They are having a problem with <br>911.  <br> <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
